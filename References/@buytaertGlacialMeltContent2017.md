1. Accelerated melting of glaciers is expected to have a negative effect on the water resources of mountain regions and their adjacent lowlands, with tropical mountain regions being among the most vulnerable. In order to quantify those impacts, it is necessary to understand the changing dynamics of glacial melting, but also to map how glacial meltwater contributes to current and future water use.
2. While the dynamics of tropical glacial melt are increasingly well understood and documented, major uncertainty remains on how the contribution of tropical glacial meltwater propagates through the hydrological system.
3. Reliance on glacial meltwater increases sharply during drought conditions (upto 3.92 million domestic users, 2096 km2 of irrigated land, and 732 MW of hydropower production in the driest month of a drought year).
4. In arid and semiarid regions in particular it is estimated that between 50 % and 90 % of freshwater resources originate from mountain catchments (Messerli et al 2004)
5. Andean glaciers provide a buffer for highly seasonal precipitation regimes (Kaser et al 2010)
6. Under the currently available climate change projections it is expected that glacial mass loss will continue in future decades, and that several smaller glaciers will dissapear completely (Vuille 2008; Rabatel 2013)
7. This is a necessary precondition for identifying spatiotemporal dynamics and hotspots of human vulnerability.
8. This is necessarily an arbitrary choice, but provides a benchmark for comparison.
9. These trends stress the importance of increased water storage capacity as a pathway for climate adaptation. Because of the challenges and cost related to artificial storage efforts, novel solutions such as green infrastructure to promote water infiltration and natural storage capacity are gaining traction (e.g. Gammie and De Bievre 2005)
10. We find large uncertainties in our estimates, which are mostly the result of uncertainties in the glacier and hydrological models. These highlight the need for further data collection and process understanding.
