1. To cope with seasonal water scarcity at critical times for irrigation, villagers in the region have developed four types of artificial ice reservoirs: basins, cascades, diversions and a form known locally as ice stupas. All these types of ice reservoirs capture water in the autumn and winter, allowing it to freeze, and hold it until spring, when it melts and flows down to fields. [[@clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017]] [[@nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019]]. 
3. Questions whether [[Ice stupas]] are a long term adaptation technology given climate change?
4. Questions the benefits of [[AIR]] given their cost


## Takeaways
Point 1 and 2 can be used to defined [[AIR]]
Point 3 and 4 discuss problems of the technology.
