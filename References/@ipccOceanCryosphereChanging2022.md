1. To cope with seasonal water scarcity at critical times for [[irrigation]], villagers in the region have developed four types of artificial ice reservoirs: basins, cascades, diversions and a form known locally as ice stupas. All these types of ice reservoirs capture water in the autumn and winter, allowing it to freeze, and hold it until spring, when it melts and flows down to fields. [[@clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017]] [[@nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019]]. In this way, they retain a previously unused portion of the annual flow and facilitate its use to supplement the decreased flow in the following spring [[@vinceGlacierMan2009]]
3. [[@nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019]] examined 14 ice reservoirs, including ice stupas, and concluded that they serve as "site-secific water conservation strategies" and that they can be regarded as appropriate local technologies to reduce water scarcity at critical times.
4. However, the study questioned their usefulness as a long term adaptation strategy, because their operation depends on winter runoff and freeze-thaw cycles, both of which are sensitive to interannual variability, and often deviate from the optimum range required for effective functioning of the reservoirs.
5. [[@nusserSociohydrologyArtificialGlaciers2019]] raises questions about the financial costs and labour requirements of [[AIR]].


## Takeaways
Point 1 and 2 can be used to defined [[AIR]]
Point 3 recognizes [[AIR]] as a climate change adaptation technology.
Point 4 and 5 discuss problems of the technology.
