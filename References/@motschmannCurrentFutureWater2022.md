1. Vanishing glaciers, natural hazards (like inumdations, mudflows, and landslides), decreasing river discharge, drying springs, next to shifts in precipitation patterns are apparent climate change impacts noticed by the local population in one way or another.
2. Water resources management needs to deal with both high and low flow water hazards. In this context high flow hazards refer to hazards that involve a large amount of water that exceeds the normal water flow, such as rain storms or (outburst) floods. Low flow hazards on the other hand are defined by conditions where water flow is insufficient and below normal average, such as droughts, aridity or in our case water scarcity.
3. Typical for the Peruvian Andes is a seasonal climate with a wet season between October and April and a dry season between May and September. During the dry season, people in these catchments depend more strongly on glacial melt water (Mark and McKenzie 2007), which feeds the rivers that essentially support agricultural activities in the catchments and also contributes to water springs (Somers et al 2018) that are important sources for domestic demand of people in the rural areas.
4. Water scarcity is defined as the situation where insufficient water resources are available to satisfy long-term average requirements (EU 2007) or as overexploitation of water resources when demand for water is higher than water availability.
5. The catchment of Chicon has a current glacier coverage of more than 6 %. In general, the runoff in Chicon is low, barely exceeding 1.2 m3/s even during the wet season. Runoff during the dry months is very low and goes down to only 0.2 m3/s. The glacier melt water contribution is comparatively low but still has an important impact. THe situation potentially worsens in the future, where the runoff in the hig-emission scenario RCP8.5 is constantly below 1 m3/s and goes down to 0.1 m3/s. The reduction in glacial melt water contribution would significantly decrease the water availability in the catchment.
6. THe two case studies presented here from the Andes show that both water scarcity (low-flow water risk) and GLOFs (high-flow water risks) could have important impacts on local population, infrastructure and economic activities. 
7. In glacierized catchments where glacier melt is an important source of water in the dry season climate change and glacier shrinkage combine with rising water demands to exacerbate water scarcity in the future.
