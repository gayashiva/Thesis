1. [[AIR]] storage volume estimate between 1010 to 3220 m3
2. [[AIR]] crop cycle range from 0.1 to 3
3. Provides [[irrigation]] area and methodology to estimate crop cycles

4. Due to low temperatures and the high variability of seasonal snow cover [[@mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015]], there is a shortage of water at the onset of the agricultural season for about two months until a sufficient and reliable supply of meltwater from high-altitude glaciers becomes available.
5. [[AIR]] serve to bridge the gap in water availability by providing meltwater earlier in the agricultural season.
6. Argue that [[AIR]] better term than [[artificial glacier]]
7. Published quantifications of their ice storage capacity differs between 17,000 and 23500 m3 [[@norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015]], [[@baglaArtificialGlaciersHelp1998]]. Recent research has called for an examination of their long-term efficacy and their usefulness as climate change adaptation strategies [[@clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017]]. We attempt to address this gap by ..
8. [[@norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015]] state that 2-5 cm of water flooding needed for  [[irrigation]]
9. Seasonal snow cover characterized by uneven distribution and duration contributes significantly to runoff in spring [[@mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015]] 
10. The period after 1995 is characterized by a decreasing trend of average ppt amounts [[@chevuturiClimateChangeLeh2018]]
11. It provides mean monthly and annual temperature trends in [[Ladakh]]
12. Quantifies glacier retreat in the Himalayas
13. Although glacier decrease is not as pronounced as in other Himalayan regions, even small climatic shifts influence water storage and runoff in cold-arid regions, crucial for the functioning of irrigation systems  [[@barnettPotentialImpactsWarming2005]], [[@parveenIRRIGATIONUPPERHUNZA2015]]
14. Due to the short growing period, [[Ladakh]] is a single cropping area with barley and wheat as important staples, complemented by vegetables, pulses and oil seeds. Depending on altitudinal position, [[irrigation]] with complete flooding of field (2-5 cm water column) starts between March and April prior to the melting of high altitude glaciers.
15. Provides good evolution of water storage technology from zings to snow harvesting
16. According to oral history and corona imagery from 1969, the first cascade ice reservoirs are older than 50 years and can be found in Phuktse and Igoo.
17. Can use potential irrigation cycle metric and area data from this pub.
18. There are great differences in ice accumulation among investigated structures.
19. Underestimates [[ice stupa]] volume as 150 m3
20. Due to the complex set of variables, the environmental conditions for optimal functioning of [[AIR]] remain uncertain.
21. Agriculture in [[Ladakh]] is primarily for subsistence.
22. This practice can be traced back to the 1960's
