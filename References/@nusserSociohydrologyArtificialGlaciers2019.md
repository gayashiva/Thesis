- [[AIR]] storage volume estimate between 1010 to 3220 m3
- [[AIR]] crop cycle range from 0.1 to 3
- Provides [[irrigation]] area and methodology to estimate crop cycles
- Due to low temperatures and the high variability of seasonal snow cover [[@mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015]], there is a shortage of water at the onset of the agricultural season for about two months until a sufficient and reliable supply of meltwater from high-altitude glaciers becomes available.
- [[AIR]] serve to bridge the gap in water availability by providing meltwater earlier in the agricultural season.
- Argue that [[AIR]] better term than [[artificial glacier]]
- Published quantifications of their ice storage capacity differs between 17,000 and 23500 m3 [[@norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015]], [[@baglaArtificialGlaciersHelp1998]]. Recent research has called for an examination of their long-term efficacy and their usefulness as climate change adaptation strategies [[@clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017]]. We attempt to address this gap by ...
- [[@norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015]] state that 2-5 cm of water flooding needed for  [[irrigation]]
- Seasonal snow cover characterized by uneven distribution and duration contributes significantly to runoff in spring [[@mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015]] 
- The period after 1995 is characterized by a decreasing trend of average ppt amounts [[@chevuturiClimateChangeLeh2018]]
- It provides mean monthly and annual temperature trends in [[Ladakh]]
- Quantifies glacier retreat in the Himalayas
- Although glacier decrease is not as pronounced as in other Himalayan regions, even small climatic shifts influence water storage and runoff in cold-arid regions, crucial for the functioning of irrigation systems  [[@barnettPotentialImpactsWarming2005]], [[@parveenIRRIGATIONUPPERHUNZA2015]]
- Due to the short growing period, [[Ladakh]] is a single cropping area with barley and wheat as important staples, complemented by vegetables, pulses and oil seeds. Depending on altitudinal position, [[irrigation]] with complete flooding of field (2-5 cm water column) starts between March and April prior to the melting of high altitude glaciers.
- Provides good evolution of water storage technology from zings to snow harvesting
- According to oral history and corona imagery from 1969, the first cascade ice reservoirs are older than 50 years and can be found in Phuktse and Igoo.
- Can use potential irrigation cycle metric and area data from this pub.
- There are great differences in ice accumulation among investigated structures.
- Underestimates [[ice stupa]] volume as 150 m3
- Due to the complex set of variables, the environmental conditions for optimal functioning of [[AIR]] remain uncertain.
- Agriculture in [[Ladakh]] is primarily for subsistence.
- This practice can be traced back to the 1960's
- Benefits include increase of cash crop production and tree plantations.
- Claims [[AIR]] only reduce water scarcity in spring.
