1. [[AIR]] storage volume estimate between 1010 to 3220 m3
2. [[AIR]] crop cycle range from 0.1 to 3
3. Provides [[irrigation]] area and methodology to estimate crop cycles

4. Due to low temperatures and the high variability of seasonal snow cover [[@mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015]], there is a shortage of water at the onset of the agricultural season for about two months until a sufficient and reliable supply of meltwater from high-altitude glaciers becomes available.
5. [[AIR]] serve to bridge the gap in water availability by providing meltwater earlier in the agricultural season.
6. Published quantifications of their ice storage capacity differs between 17,000 and 23500 m3 [[@norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015]], [[@baglaArtificialGlaciersHelp1998]]. Recent research has called for an examination of their long-term efficacy and their usefulness as climate change adaptation strategies [[@clouseLadakhArtificialGlaciers2017]]. We attempt to address this gap by ..
7. [[@norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015]] state that 2-5 cm of water flooding needed for  [[irrigation]]
8. Seasonal snow cover characterized by uneven distribution and duration contributes significantly to runoff in spring [[@mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015]] 
9. The period after 1995 is characterized by a decreasing trend of average ppt amounts [[@chevuturiClimateChangeLeh2018]]
10. It provides mean monthly and annual temperature trends in [[Ladakh]]
11. Quantifies glacier retreat in the Himalayas
12. Although glacier decrease is not as pronounced as in other Himalayan regions, even small climatic shifts influence water storage and runoff in cold-arid regions, crucial for the functioning of [[irrigation]] systems  [[@barnettPotentialImpactsWarming2005]], [[@parveenIRRIGATIONUPPERHUNZA2015]]
13. Due to the short growing period, [[Ladakh]] is a single cropping area with barley and wheat as important staples, complemented by vegetables, pulses and oil seeds. Depending on altitudinal position, [[irrigation]] with complete flooding of field (2-5 cm water column) starts between March and April prior to the melting of high altitude glaciers.
14. In order to cope with recurrent water  scarcity, water harvesting technologies and community arrangements have been developed. These include the zing, which are small ponds in close proximity to the cultivated fields, where water is collected temporarily for irrigation. Other traditional water storage techniques include small barrier walls for "snow harvesting" in the upper catchments. (Dawa et al 2000)
15. According to oral history and corona imagery from 1969, the first cascade ice reservoirs are older than 50 years and can be found in Phuktse and Igoo.

## Takeaways 
Quantifies [[AIR]] meltwater usage through crop cycles and irrigated area. (1,2,3)
Explains the need of AIRs (4,5)
Quantification of AIR volume is difficult. There are great differences in ice accumulation among investigated structures. Due to the complex set of variables, the environmental conditions for optimal functioning of [[AIR]] remain uncertain. (6)
[[irrigation]] water need is quantified (3, 7, 13)
Cryosphere fed irrigation (8)
[[Climate change]] is quantified (9, 10, 11, 12)
Evolution of [[AIR]] #technology (14)
First recorded #history of [[AIR]] (15)
Underestimates [[ice stupa]] volume as 150 m3
