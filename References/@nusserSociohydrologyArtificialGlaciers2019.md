- [[AIR]] storage volume estimate between 1010 to 3220 m3
- [[AIR]] crop cycle range from 0.1 to 3
- Provides [[irrigation]] area and methodology to estimate crop cycles
- Due to low temperatures and the high variability of seasonal snow cover [[@mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015]], there is a shortage of water at the onset of the agricultural season for about two months until a sufficient and reliable supply of meltwater from high-altitude glaciers becomes available.
- [[AIR]] serve to bridge the gap in water availability by providing meltwater earlier in the agricultural season.
- Argue that [[AIR]] better term than [[artificial glacier]]
