1.  It is not known who started the practice of glacier grafting, but according to oral history it is as old as the local communities.  
2.  suggests that the technique was developed as a result of the local people’s deep understanding of local environmental processes. 
3.  Myths, legends and superstitions are ways of knowing. But they need to be translated to the language of science. 
4.  The glaciers that people help to grow are the fruit of the sacred union between a mother glacier and a father glacier. They get married and have offspring. The baby glaciers also turn out to be either male or female. That’s an obvious fact. Everybody in Baltistan knows that glaciers, rivers and water are all either male or female.
5.  It is relatively easy to discern the gender of the glacier. The female glaciers – mo gang in the Balti language – are usually white or blue, they give plenty of water and grow fast. The male glaciers – po gang – give little water and are often covered by stones and soil, giving them a black appearance.
6.  The selection of an appropriate site for glacier grafting is of utmost importance, and a suitable spot must fulfil a list of conditions. It should be located at an altitude of at least 4000 or 5000 metres above sea level; it should be on a gentle slope, where it should have minimal exposure to sunlight, thus a north-facing mountain side is preferable. For most of the expert glacier grafters, the presence of permafrost or ice on the site is another key requirement.
7. Once a suitable spot is selected, the expedition can be planned. The bride and the groom – the female and the male glacier, preferably from different villages – are chosen and the marriage can be planned. The glacier grafting usually takes place in November, when the local temperatures oscillate around zero. A 12-man party carries the pieces of female ice in woven baskets, another 12 men carry the male ice, the water drawn from the Indus river is carried traditionally in 12 gourd bottles, but sometimes clay pots or goatskins are also required, as well as charcoal and wheat husks or sawdust, which act as insulators for the ice. The last ingredient is salt, which, according to some glacier grafters, helps protect the new glacier from impurities. The bride and groom party walk from different sites and meet in a certain spot to climb together to the glacier growing site, but no greetings are exchanged, as the people involved in the ceremony must remain silent until the ice is deposited in its new home. They walk continuously without having a break, but if the distance is too much and rest is required, they do not put their loads on the ground, instead hanging the baskets on trees, or on walking sticks if nothing else is available. Each man has to carry around 15 to 25 kilograms of ice, walking in cold air, silently up the mountains, for a day or more. Once they reach the glacier growing site, they deposit their valuable loads. The ice lumps and water bottles are placed in between the boulders, or in a small cave, or sometimes in a specially dug pit, and covered with layers of salt, charcoal and sawdust. The silence is broken as religious leaders recite verses of the Quran and say prayers for the success of the glacier marriage and for protection from the djinns. Once the male and female glaciers are placed in their new home and covered, a man from the party of glacier grafters stands up and offers his life for the success of the process. His symbolic sacrifice is matched by the actual sacrifice of a goat – its meat is distributed to a charity, because prayers are more likely to be answered if accompanied by an act of charity. They will not visit the place for at least three years, so as not to disturb the glacier. It is said that a person who disturbs the glacier before its maturation will die. The celebrations continue in the village with traditional songs and prayers, alongside festive food and the joy of the accomplished mission.
