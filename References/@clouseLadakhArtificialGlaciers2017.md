- [[Climate change]] change induced water scarcity threatens the survival of subsistence agricultural practices in many communities.
- "While much has been written about the promise of artificial glaciers for farming in [[Ladakh]], very little data exists to support these claims [[@vinceGlacierMan2009]] " 
- A spirit of improvisation guides the design and construction of [[AIR]] making it difficult to make a quantitative comparison from site to site.
- Glaciers can be thought of as 'time machines', storing water in one place over many decades - unlike rain, or even seasonal snow melt, that typically reaches the stream flow within days to months. Can use this to define [[AIR]]
- Indian Himalayas lost 20 percent in the last six decades.
- [[Ladakh]] agriculture economy employs 70 percent of Ladakh workforce (Humbert Droz and Daisa, 2004)
- Argues that [[AIR]] are a natural evolution of Ladakh's agricultural system.
- Low snowfall winter is indicative of summer drought.
- [[HAIR]] cost USD6000 to 22000 but this is much less than the cost of traditional infrastructure  [[@vinceGlacierMan2009]]
- [[AIR]] are engineered systems exploiting gravity and freezing winter temperatures to amass a seasonal stock of ice.
- [[AIR]] can be categorised as perpetual and seasonal IRs [[PIR]] and [[SIR]]
- Claims volume of [[AIR]] has never been recorded.
- Claims that [[AIR]] must be viewed as an interim solution, not as a substitution for climate mitigation.
- Farmers have employed [[AIR]] to gain some control over their water security.
