- Climate change induced water scarcity threatens the survival of subsistence agricultural practices in many communities.
- "While much has been written about the promise of artificial glaciers for farming in [Ladakh], very little data exists to support these claims [@vinceGlacierMan2009] " 
- A spirit of improvisation guides the design and construction of [AIRs] making it difficult to make a quantitative comparison from site to site.
- Glaciers can be thoght of as 'time machines', storing water in one place over many decades - unlike rain, or even seasonal snow melt, that typically reaches the stream flow within days to months. Can use this to define [AIRs]
- Indian Himalayas lost 20 percent in the last six decades.
- Ladakh agriculture economy employs 70 percent of Ladakh workforce (Humbert Droz and Daisa, 2004)
- Argues that [AIRs] are a natural evolution of Ladakh's agricultural system.
- Low snowfall winter is indicative of summer drought.
- [HAIRs] cost USD6000 to 22000 but this is much less than the cost of traditional infrastructure  [@vinceGlacierMan2009]
- [AIRs] are engineered systems exploiting gravity and freezing winter temperatures to amass a seasonal stock of ice.
- [AIRs] can be categorised as perpetual and seasonal IRs[PIRs], [SIRs].
- Claims volume of [AIRs] has never been recorded.
- Claims that [AIRs] must be viewed as an interim solution, not as a substitution for climate mitigation.
- Farmers have employed [AIRs] to gain some control over their water security.
