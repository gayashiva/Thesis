1. [[Climate change]] change induced water scarcity threatens the survival of subsistence agricultural practices in many communities.
2. While much has been written about the promise of artificial glaciers for farming in [[Ladakh]], very little data exists to support these claims [[@vinceGlacierMan2009]]
3. A spirit of improvisation guides the design and construction of [[AIR]] making it difficult to make a quantitative comparison from site to site.
4. Glaciers can be thought of as 'time machines', storing water in one place over many decades - unlike rain, or even seasonal snow melt, that typically reaches the stream flow within days to months.
5. Indian Himalayas lost 20 percent in the last six decades.
6. [[Ladakh]] agriculture economy employs 70 percent of Ladakh workforce (Humbert Droz and Daisa, 2004)
7. Argues that [[AIR]] are a natural evolution of Ladakh's agricultural system.
8. Low snowfall winter is indicative of summer drought.
9. [[HAIR]] cost USD6000 to 22000 but this is much less than the cost of traditional infrastructure  [[@vinceGlacierMan2009]]
10. [[AIR]] are engineered systems exploiting gravity and freezing winter temperatures to amass a seasonal stock of ice.
11. [[AIR]] can be categorised as perpetual and seasonal IRs [[PIR]] and [[SIR]]
12. Claims that [[AIR]] must be viewed as an interim solution, not as a substitution for climate mitigation.
13. Farmers have employed [[AIR]] to gain some control over their water security. 

## Takeaways
Point 1, 5 and 8 can be expanded into a paragraph to explain how water scarcity affects mountain regions around the world
Point 2, 3 and 12 can be used to indicate the current problems of [[AIR]] technology
Point 4, 10 and 11 can be used to define [[AIR]]
Point 6 shows importance of agriculture in [[Ladakh]]
Point 7 can be used to show progreesion of [[AIR]] technology
Point 9 quantifies cost of [[AIR]]
Point 13 talks about adoption of the technology.
