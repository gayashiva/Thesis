# [[Inspire Faculty Proposal]]

## Origin of the proposal
Irrigated agriculture is crucial for the livelihood security of mountain communities.
Using meltwater from glaciers, snow and permafrost, mountain dwellers have
developed sophisticated techniques to cope with recurrent water scarcity caused
by glacial retreat, glacier thining, and seasonal snow-cover dynamics. Artificial ice
reservoirs (AIRs) are a key example of such a water storage technology. More than 500 mountain farmers in Ladakh build these ice structures. These seasonal ice
reservoirs increase meltwater availability during the critical period of water scarcity
in spring. To assess the role of AIRs within the water resource management
of mountain villages under a changing climate, they need to be represented in
integrated modelling frameworks like glacier models. To reduce their water losses,
their construction strategies need to be made sensitive to the locationâ€™s weather
conditions and water availability. 


## Objectives


## Brief outline of the methodology

The methodology followed will be similar to the one used in our previous research. We will develop software and hardware tools that quantify volume evolution of ice terraces and improve their water-use efficiency.

In a first step, weather stations, discharge loggers and drones will be deployed to calibrate and validate the ice terrace software developed. In a second step, automation hardware will be des
 

## Significance of the proposal in the context of current status in the field

Despite this widespread adoption, only a few publications examine the role of AIRs
in the water resource management in these regions. Notably, none of these prior
reports have investigated AIRs outside Ladakh. Moreover, quantifications of water
storage capacity of AIRs in Ladakh vary widely between these studies [29, 2].

Quantifying the water storage capacity of AIRs is not straightforward since the
processes by which AIRs are formed are complex. These processes are controlled
by local topography, meteorology and the construction strategies used. Modelling
approaches to quantify these processes exist on glacier surfaces but they are not
readily applicable for AIRs due to their limited size, and comparatively more variable
surface area. Therefore, further modification of glacial modelling approaches are
required for them to be sensitive to the spatial and temporal scale of AIR surface
processes. Furthermore, these modelling approaches need to be validated and
calibrated with comprehensive data from in-situ field measurements.

A spirit of improvisation guides the construction strategies of AIRs [10]. Depending
on the topography of the construction location and how water is supplied, AIRs can
form as flat sheets or vertical cones. This has resulted in ice reservoirs exhibiting
significant volume variations despite experiencing similar meteorological conditions.
For example, ice terraces have attained volumes upto 30 times larger than ice stupas
built in Ladakh, India [30]. However, the processes driving these differences can
only be understood if the complete methodology behind the construction strategy
used is available.

## Prospects of this work for extending it as a long term project


## Research done so far

My research done so far focussed on estimating the volume evolution of ice stupas and improving their water-use efficiency using software and hardware tools respectively. 

The software tool we developed was an AIR-specific mass and energy balance model that estimated the quantity of ice, meltwater, sublimation, and wastewater. The calibration and validation data basis for this software was the weather, water, and volume measurements carried out with an enormous input of manpower in the Indian Himalayas and the Swiss Alps. In total, volume of around 25 AIRs were measured with drone flights across four winters with the support of colleagues from University of Fribourg and Himalayan Institute of Alternatives. Description of datasets associated with 5 AIRs can be found in the published literature.

The AIR software was used to estimate the differing contribution of AIR surface processes built in Guttannen, Switzerland and Ladakh, India. These two locations exhibit different meteorological patterns owing to their significant latitude, longitude and altitude differences. The results revealed that the sublimation process was driving the ice volume differences, and fountain operation of both the AIRs utilized less than one-fifth of the water supply provided. This case study highlighted the importance of colder, drier climates and fountain water supply management when building AIRs with higher volumes and lower water losses.

In response, we developed an automation hardware that could implement fountain scheduling strategies through the AIR software using real-time weather input and location metadata. Simulations converting unscheduled fountains to scheduled fountains improved the water use efficiency of several AIRs more than three fold. Fountain operation using scheduling strategies produced similar ice volumes while consuming one-tenth of the water the unscheduled fountain used. Overall, these results showed that automated fountain water supply management can both increase the water use efficiency of AIRs and reduce their maintenance without compromising on their meltwater production.
