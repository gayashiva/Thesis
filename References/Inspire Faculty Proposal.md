# [[Inspire Faculty Proposal]]

## Origin of the proposal
Irrigated agriculture is crucial for the livelihood security of mountain communities.
Using meltwater from glaciers, snow and permafrost, mountain dwellers have
developed sophisticated techniques to cope with recurrent water scarcity caused
by glacial retreat, glacier thining, and seasonal snow-cover dynamics. Artificial ice
reservoirs (AIRs) are a key example of such a water storage technology. More than 500 mountain farmers in Ladakh build these ice structures. These seasonal ice
reservoirs increase meltwater availability during the critical period of water scarcity
in spring. To assess the role of AIRs within the water resource management
of mountain villages under a changing climate, they need to be represented in
integrated modelling frameworks like glacier models. To reduce their water losses,
their construction strategies need to be made sensitive to the locationâ€™s weather
conditions and water availability. 

## Objectives


## Brief outline of the methodology

## Significance of the proposal in the context of current status in the field

## Prospects of this work for extending it as a long term project

## Research done so far

My research done so far focussed on estimating the volume evolution of artificial ice reservoirs(AIR) and improving their water-use efficiency using software and hardware tools respectively. 

The software tool we developed was an AIR-specific mass and energy balance model that estimated the quantity of ice, meltwater, sublimation, and wastewater. The weather, water, and volume measurements carried out with an enormous input of manpower in the Indian Himalayas and the Swiss Alps provided a unique data basis for calibrating and validating this model. In total, volume of around 25 AIRs were measured regularly with drone flights across four winters with the support of colleagues from University of Fribourg and Himalayan Institute of Alternatives. Description of datasets associated with 5 AIRs can be found in the published literature.

The AIR software was used to estimate the differing contribution of AIR surface processes built in Guttannen, Switzerland and Ladakh, India. These two locations exhibit different meteorological patterns owing to their significant latitude, longitude and altitude differences. The results revealed that the sublimation process was driving the ice volume differences, and fountain operation of both the AIRs utilized less than one-fifth of the water supply provided. This case study highlighted the importance of colder, drier climates and fountain water supply management when building AIRs with higher volumes and lower water losses.

In response, we developed an automation hardware that could implement fountain scheduling strategies through the AIR software using real-time weather input and location metadata. Simulations converting unscheduled fountains to scheduled fountains improved the water use efficiency of several AIRs more than three fold. Fountain operation using scheduling strategies produced similar ice volumes while consuming one-tenth of the water the unscheduled fountain used. Overall, these results showed that automated fountain water supply management can both increase the water use efficiency of AIRs and reduce their maintenance without compromising on their meltwater production.
