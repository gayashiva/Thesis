1. Small-scale agriculture is still the most widespread subsistence activity in the Cordillera Blanca (CB). This type of farming, extending between 3000 and 4000 m a.s.l., is rain-fed in the wet season and primarily depends on glacial melt water during the dry season (Mark et al 2010).
2. Glacial contribution was estimated as glacial area times melting rates (4 and 10 mm/day for dry and wet seasons).
3. Modelling of runoff and groundwater components is based on Temez equations (Temez 1977) which is a 4-parameter simplified 2-bucket model: one for groundwater and one for surface runoff.
4. The crop requirement is based on the planted area, ETo, and the crop coefficient (Kc), which takes into account the growth stages according to FAO (Allen et al 1998).
5. The Quechua word (in Ancash) for snow covered peaks is raju and does not distinguidh between mountains ans glaciers, which shows the close connection of the two. In peruvian andes, many people consider glaciated mountains and lakes to be living beings that require respectful engagement (Bolin 2009, Stensrud 2016, Rasmussen 2018).
6. In the Quillcay catchment, groundwater, glacial, and runoff represent 41, 37 and 22 % of annual water supply. During dry season it changes to 60, 40, 0. In 2012 the glacial area of the Quillcay was 32.6 km2. In the RCP2.6 scenrio the glacial area shrinks to 23.8 and in RCP 8.5 to just 1.5 km2. THe monthly change in water balance by the end of the twenty-first century compared with present conditions fluctuates between - 6 and - 15 % for RCP2.6 and between -21 and -54 % for RCP8.5. Overall, comparing the total yerly water supply of 2012 of roughly 262 M m3 with the end of the twenty first century, the yearly supply would decrease by 22 M m3 (RCP2.6) to 77 M m3 (RCP8.5) only due to glacial retreat. 22 M m3 could irrigate 4760 ha and would mean 50 M USD crop-equivalent for potatoes based on wholesale price of March 2019.
