1. In the tropical Andes, pre-Ince cultures developed nature-based water harvesting technologies to manage drought risks under natural climatic extremes.
2. While these technologies have gained renewed attention as a potential strategy to increase water security, limited scientific evidence exists about their potential hydrological contributions at catchment scale
3. may provide a critical complement to conventional engineering solutions for water security.
4. The limitations of solutions on the basis of 'grey' infrastructure, such as artificial reservoirs, are becoming clear, for example, high sunk costs, complex planning and implementation and limited adaptive capacity. This has brought a renewed interest in nature-based solutions or 'green' infrastructure that can be implemented gradually, adjusted after implementation and provide several benefits that make them compatible with climate change adaptation in an increasingly uncertain and complex world @unescoUnitedNationsWorld2018
5. We describe and quantify the hydrological functioning of a 1400 year-old infiltration system in the Andean highlands near Lima.
6. Our findings are essential to design nature-ba
