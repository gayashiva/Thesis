1. In the tropical Andes, pre-Inca cultures developed nature-based water harvesting technologies to manage drought risks under natural climatic extremes.
2. While these technologies have gained renewed attention as a potential strategy to increase water security, limited scientific evidence exists about their potential hydrological contributions at catchment scale
3. may provide a critical complement to conventional engineering solutions for water security.
4. The limitations of solutions on the basis of 'grey' infrastructure, such as artificial reservoirs, are becoming clear, for example, high sunk costs, complex planning and implementation and limited adaptive capacity. This has brought a renewed interest in nature-based solutions or 'green' infrastructure that can be implemented gradually, adjusted after implementation and provide several benefits that make them compatible with climate change adaptation in an increasingly uncertain and complex world @unescoUnitedNationsWorld2018
5. We describe and quantify the hydrological functioning of a 1400 year-old infiltration system in the Andean highlands near Lima.
6. Our findings are essential to design nature-based solutions that increase the reliability of water supply in highly seasonal and arid environments and improve water security and climate change adaptation in mountain regions.
7. This study provides the scientific evidence needed to upscale indigenous infrastructure, thus challenging the preconception that local water management traditions are outdated and supporting the uptake of nature-based solutions for water-security.
8. We combined hydrological monitoring and teacer experiments to charecterize hydrological functioning.
9. We estimate that the practice can divert and infiltrate approximately 35 % OF THE WET SEASON FLOW OF THE ENTIRE Rimac basin and increase the basin dry-season volumes by 7.5 % on average and up to 33 % during the early dry months.
