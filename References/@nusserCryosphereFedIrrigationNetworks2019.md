1. The effect of cryosphere change on local meltwater-dependent irrigation practices has received much less attention [[@kreutzmannWaterTowersMankind1998]], even though dependence on glacier meltwater and vulnerability to cryosphere dynamics are of serious concern in all mountain areas.
2. The IPCC's report projects that glaciers will continue to shrink even without further temperature increase, which reinforces the urgency of understanding adaptation to glacier meltwater dynamics.
3. As more than 75 % of the total annual runoff in the Astore Basin depends on meltwater produced by glaciers and seasonal snow cover [[@farhanHydrologicalRegimesConjunction2015]], irrigated agriculture in the Rupal valley is dominantly cryosphere fed.
4. A general glacier decrease is evident for the Trans-Himalaya of [[Ladakh]] between 1969 and 2016, with glaciated area reduction ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 % per year across different watersheds[[@schmidtChangesHighAltitude2017]] 
5. Igoo irrigated area is 3.07 km2
6. The cryosphere fed [[irrigation]] network in the cold arid region [[Ladakh]] has always been prone to water scarcity in spring [[@labbalTraditionalOasesLadakh2000]],[[@dameSTONGDEREVISITEDLANDUSE2010]] 
7. Huge effort for reconstruction of [[HAIR]]: 275 residents donating their labor over a week in Igoo.
8. As an income generating activity, tree plantations and cash crop production especially of potatoes and peas provide valuable incentives for communities.
