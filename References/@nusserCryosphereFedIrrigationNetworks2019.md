- The effect of cryosphere change on local meltwater-dependent irrigation practices has received much less attention [[@kreutzmannWaterTowersMankind1998]], even though dependence on glacier meltwater and vulnerability to cryosphere dynamics are of serious concern in all mountain areas.
- The IPCC's report projects that glaciers will continue to shrink even without further temperature increase, which reinforces the urgency of understanding adaptation to glacier meltwater dynamics.
-  As more than 75 % of the total annual runoff in the Astore Basin depends on meltwater produced by glaciers and seasonal snow cover [[@farhanHydrologicalRegimesConjunction2015]], irrigated agriculture in the Rupal valley is dominantly cryosphere fed.
-  A general glacier decrease is evident for the Trans-Himalaya of [[Ladakh]] between 1969 and 2016, with glaciated area reduction ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 % per year across different watersheds[[@schmidtChangesHighAltitude2017]] 
-  Igoo [[irrigated]] area is 3.07 km2
-  The cryosphere fed [[irrigation]] network in the cold arid region [[Ladakh]] has always been prone to water scarcity in spring [[@labbalTraditionalOasesLadakh2000]],[[@dameSTONGDEREVISITEDLANDUSE2010]] 
-  Huge effort for reconstruction of [[HAIR]]: 275 residents donating their labor over a week in Igoo.
-  As an income generating activity, tree plantations and cash crop production especially of potatoes and peas provide valuable incentives for communities.
