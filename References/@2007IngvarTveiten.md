1. People in the districts of Baltistan and Gilgit pratice glacier growing with the intention of making glaciers that will enhance water availability. This is done by carrying glacier ice from a naturally occurring glacier up to elevations over 4000 m a.s.l., where it is placed in a dug out cave in a scree slope.
2. The perception that glaciers are animated and open to human influence, can be seen as a cultural condition for how the people of this area view glacier growing as feasible to produce new glaciers.
3. In order to grow glaciers, one needs to marry a female and a male glacier.
4. Our forefathers have taught us that the 'mo gang' gives much water, while the 'po gang' gives little water. In Shigar there are two types of glacier. One nallah has a big glacier, but with little water coming from it: that one is 'po glacier'. Another nallah has a smaller glacier but much water coming from it: that one is a 'mo glacier'. We took ice from the 'mo glacier'. The female is giving birth, so we need that kind of glacier.
5. The hardships that people go through in order to secure ice of both genders for glacier growing is also an indication of the importance they bestow upon this process.
6. Most glacier growing sites in talus slope. The glacier growers recognized that this would protect the ice against solar radiation.
7. 300 kg of ice, water, coal and sawdust was placed inside this cave during the glacier growing that took place in 2000.
8. Observed one meter ice accumulation.
9. Glaciers are not perceived as a natural phenomenon, but as a manifestation of a successful cooperation between humans and nature.
10. There is a part played by 'nature' and one played by 'humans'
11. Seasonal fluctuation in river discharge poses challenges to the farmers here.Peak flow occurs in July and August, and can cause flooding which damage irrigation canals, roads, and crops. Low flow periods in March, April, Sep, Oct, on the other hand may inhibit the early growth and maturation of crops.
12. Presence of a glacier in the watershed affects water availibility as the maximum monthly runoff is delayed and interannual variations in runoff are reduced. This fact has implications for agriculture as farmers in a non-glacierized basin strive to get enough water for their crops after snowmelt has finished.
13. Water is the limiting factor of agricultural expansion.
14. Glacier growing works because rock glacier exists. The contribution of humans to the ice accumulation is small.
15. Permafrost presence in talus slopes
16. The view of glaciers as animate implies that humans can influence on the lives of glaciers, just as glaciers can influence on the lives of people.
