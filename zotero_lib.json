  {"id":"abrishambafAgriculturalIrrigationScheduling2020","abstract":"Center pivot systems are widely used to overcome the irrigation needs of agricultural fields. In this paper, an autonomous approach is proposed in order to improve the low efficiency of irrigation by developing a system based on the water requirement of the plantations, through field data. The data are local temperature, local wind, soil moisture, precipitation forecast, and soil evapotranspiration calculation. This information enables the system to calculate the real evapotranspiration for not being necessary to restrict to lysimetric measures. By this way, the system schedules the irrigation for the lower cost periods, considering the produced energy by the local resources, and the price of energy purchased from the utility grid. Also, it is considered that the irrigation must be carried out within the time interval in which the plantations do not reach the wilding point, so it will be carried out at the periods with the lowest cost. This will optimize the overall operational costs of the irrigation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Abrishambaf","given":"Omid"},{"family":"Faria","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Gomes","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Vale","given":"Zita"}],"citation-key":"abrishambafAgriculturalIrrigationScheduling2020","collection-title":"The 6th International Conference on Energy and Environment Research - Energy and environment: challenges towards circular economy","container-title":"Energy Reports","container-title-short":"Energy Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.egyr.2019.08.031","ISSN":"2352-4847","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"133-139","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Agricultural irrigation scheduling for a crop management system considering water and energy use optimization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484719306250","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"aggarwalAdaptationClimateChange2021","abstract":"Mountains are a critical source of water. Cryospheric and hydrological changes in combination with socio-economic development are threatening downstream water security triggering the need for effective adaptation responses. Here, we present a global systematic review (83 peer-reviewed articles) that assesses different water-related stressors and the adaptation responses to manage water stress in major glaciated mountain regions. Globally, agriculture (42%), tourism (12%), hydropower (8%) and health and safety (4%) are among the main sectors affected by hydrological and cryospheric changes . A broad set of adaptation measures has already been implemented in the world’s mountain regions. We find that globally the most commonly used adaptation practices correspond to the improvement of water storage infrastructure (13%), green infrastructure (9.5%), agricultural practices (17%), water governance and policies (21%), disaster risk reduction (9.5%) and economic diversification (10%). Successful implementation of adaptation measures is limited by reduced stakeholder capacities, collaboration and financial resources, and policies and development. To overcome these limitations, funding for climate change adaptation and development programmes in mountains and trust-building measures such as shared stakeholder activities need to be strengthened. Local awareness raising of both, the adverse effects of climate change and potentially positive implications of specific adaptation measures can help to support successful adaptation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Anubha"},{"family":"Frey","given":"Holger"},{"family":"McDowell","given":"Graham"},{"family":"Drenkhan","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Nüsser","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Racoviteanu","given":"Adina"},{"family":"Hoelzle","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"aggarwalAdaptationClimateChange2021","container-title":"Climate and Development","DOI":"10.1080/17565529.2021.1971059","ISSN":"1756-5529","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,1]]},"page":"1-13","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Adaptation to climate change induced water stress in major glacierized mountain regions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2021.1971059","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"arndtAtmosphereDrivenMassBalance2021","abstract":"The COupled Snowpack and Ice surface energy and mass balance model in PYthon (COSIPY) was employed to investigate the relationship between the variability and sensitivity of the mass balance record of the Halji glacier, in the Himalayas, north-western Nepal, over a 40 year period since October 1981 to atmospheric drivers. COSIPY was forced with the atmospheric reanalysis dataset ERA5-Land that has been statistically downscaled to the location of an automatic weather station at the Halji glacier. Glacier mass balance simulations with air temperature and precipitation perturbations were executed and teleconnections investigated. For the mass-balance years 1982 to 2019, a mean annual glacier-wide climatic mass balance of −0.48 meters water equivalent per year (m w.e. a−1) with large interannual variability (standard deviation 0.71 m w.e. a−1) was simulated. This variability is dominated by temperature and precipitation patterns. The Halji glacier is mostly sensitive to summer temperature and monsoon-related precipitation perturbations, which is reflected in a strong correlation with albedo. According to the simulations, the climate sensitivity with respect to either positive or negative air temperature and precipitation changes is nonlinear: A mean temperature increase (decrease) of 1 K would result in a change of the glacier-wide climatic mass balance of −1.43 m w.e. a−1 (0.99 m w.e. a−1) while a precipitation increase (decrease) of 10% would cause a change of 0.45m w.e. a−1 (−0.59 m w.e. a−1). Out of 22 circulation and monsoon indexes, only the Webster and Yang Monsoon index and Polar/Eurasia index provide significant correlations with the glacier-wide climatic mass balance. Based on the strong dependency of the climatic mass balance from summer season conditions, we conclude that the snow–albedo feedback in summer is crucial for the Halji glacier. This finding is also reflected in the correlation of albedo with the Webster and Yang Monsoon index.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Arndt","given":"Anselm"},{"family":"Scherer","given":"Dieter"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"arndtAtmosphereDrivenMassBalance2021","container-title":"Atmosphere","DOI":"10.3390/atmos12040426","ISSN":"2073-4433","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"en","number":"4","page":"426","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Atmosphere Driven Mass-Balance Sensitivity of Halji Glacier, Himalayas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/4/426","volume":"12"},

In this study, suitability index approach was adopted to assess glacier resource potential for establishing kuhl irrigation system in HKH ranges of Pakistan. The basis of indexing is glacier accessibility and water yield potential of the glacial resource for irrigation estimated in terms of number and ice reserve of the glaciers.

  {"id":"balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022","abstract":"Since 2014, mountain communities in Ladakh, India have been constructing dozens of Artificial Ice Reservoirs (AIRs) by spraying water through fountain systems every winter. The meltwater from these structures is crucial to meet irrigation water demands during spring. However, there is a large variability associated with this water supply due to the local weather influences at the chosen location. This study compared the ice volume evolution of an AIR built in Ladakh, India with two others built in Guttannen, Switzerland using a surface energy balance model. Model input consisted of meteorological data in conjunction with fountain discharge rate (mass input of an AIR). Model calibration and validation were completed using ice volume and surface area measurements taken from several drone surveys. The model was successful in estimating the observed ice volume evolution with a root mean square error within 18\n              %\n              of the maximum ice volume for all the AIRs. The location in Ladakh had a maximum ice volume four times larger compared to the Guttannen site. However, the corresponding water losses for all the AIRs were more than three-quarters of the total fountain discharge due to high fountain wastewater. Drier and colder locations in relatively cloud-free regions are expected to produce long-lasting AIRs with higher maximum ice volumes. This is a promising result for dry mountain regions, where AIR technology could provide a relatively affordable and sustainable strategy to mitigate climate change induced water stress.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Balasubramanian","given":"Suryanarayanan"},{"family":"Hoelzle","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Lehning","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Bolibar","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Wangchuk","given":"Sonam"},{"family":"Oerlemans","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"balasubramanianInfluenceMeteorologicalConditions2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","container-title-short":"Front.

The presence of an insulating supraglacial debris cover alters the mass-balance profile of a glacier, potentially modifying the scaling relation. Here, the nature of scaling relations for extensively debris-covered glaciers is investigated. Theoretical arguments suggest that the volume-area scaling exponent for these glaciers is ~7% smaller than that for clean glaciers. This is consistent with the results from flowline-model simulations of idealised glaciers, and the available data from the Himalaya. The best-fit scale factor for debris-covered Himalayan glaciers is ~60% larger compared to that for the clean ones, implying a significantly larger stored ice volume in a debris-covered glacier compared to a clean one having the same area. These results may help improve scaling-based estimates of glacier volume and future glacier changes in regions where debris-covered glaciers are abundant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Argha"}],"citation-key":"banerjeeVolumeareaScalingDebriscovered2020","container-title":"Journal of Glaciology","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"barandunStateFutureCryosphere2020","abstract":"Snow, glaciers and permafrost translate fluctuations of atmospheric conditions and highlight current environmental changes. Monitoring of these changes is one of the major objectives of the international climate observation strategy developed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Under ongoing climate change, the implication of altering meltwater released by snow, ice and permafrost will become increasingly relevant for the fragile mountain and lowland environments of Central Asia. These changes will affect the livelihood, particularly for mountain communities but also for the highly populated regions downstream. A degrading cryosphere may cause drastic ecological changes and endanger water, food and health security leading to pronounced political instabilities and changing socio-hydrological interactions. For successful mitigation, the adaptation capacity has to be enforced by first creating basic observational datasets on the state and changes of the cryosphere, and secondly, by providing well-calibrated models in connection with climate scenario output. This information is a pre-condition to reduce on mid- to long-term the vulnerability of the local population. So far, significant data gaps of in situ measurements in Central Asia, mainly from the mid-1990 s to around 2010 impeded sound interpretations of long-term trends in the cryosphere. However, the progress made on glacier observation and capacity building in recent years, promises a future perspective for monitoring including snow and permafrost. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on the state of three essential climate variables (ECV) of the Central Asian cryosphere: snow, glaciers and permafrost in a context of future water security. It highlights the challenges for cryosphere assessments in the region and discusses ongoing monitoring efforts, future directions and emerging approaches, which might address current shortcomings of today’s monitoring network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Barandun","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Fiddes","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Scherler","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Mathys","given":"Tamara"},{"family":"Saks","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Petrakov","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Hoelzle","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"barandunStateFutureCryosphere2020","container-title":"Water Security","container-title-short":"Water Security","DOI":"10.1016/j.wasec.2020.100072","ISSN":"2468-3124","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"100072","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The state and future of the cryosphere in Central Asia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468312420300122","volume":"11"},

In addition to the direct effects on climate—for example, on the frequency of heatwaves—this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability—predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions—are likely to be severe.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Barnett","given":"T.

Water balance experiments in Zimbabwe showed that over 50% of the water applied as surface irrigation on traditional irrigated gardens can be lost as soil evaporation. This result gives an indication of the potential improvement in irrigation efficiency that can be achieved by adopting irrigation methods that reduce soil evaporation at the same time as minimising losses due to drainage and canopy interception. During the period 1985 to 1995, irrigation trials and experiments were carried out in south-east Zimbabwe and northern Sri Lanka with the main aim of comparing and quantifying the benefits of using simple microirrigation techniques on traditional vegetable gardens. This paper reviews the results of these trials and experiments. Microirrigation techniques that were evaluated included low-head drip irrigation, pitcher irrigation and subsurface irrigation using clay pipes. Of these methods, subsurface irrigation using clay pipes was found to be particularly effective in improving yields, crop quality and water use efficiency as well as being cheap, simple and easy to use.

Our results confirm an over-sensitivity of temperature-index models, often used by large-scale studies, to future warming. We argue that such models can be suitable for steep mountain glaciers.

Four contrasting methods for estimating mean flow, proportion of flow in February, 7-day mean annual low flow, mean annual high flow, the all-time flow duration curve and the February flow duration curve at ungauged sites across New Zealand were compared. The four methods comprised: (1) an uncalibrated national-coverage physically-based rainfall-runoff model (TopNet); (2) data-driven empirical approaches informed by hydrological theory (Hydrology of Ungauged Catchments); (3) a purely empirically-based machine learning regression model (Random Forests); and (4) correction of the TopNet estimates using flow duration curves estimated using Random Forests. Model performance was assessed through comparison with observed data from 485 gauging stations located across New Zealand. Three model performance metrics were calculated: Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency, a normalised error index statistic (the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data) and the percentage bias. Results showed that considerable gains in TopNet model performance could be made when TopNet time-series were corrected using flow duration curves estimated from Random Forests. This improvement in TopNet performance occurred regardless of two different parameterisations of the TopNet model. The Random Forests method provided the best estimates of the flow duration curves and all hydrological indices except mean flow.

  {"id":"brombierstaudlDistributionRelevanceAufeis2021","abstract":"In the semi-arid high mountains of the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), meltwater supply from the cryosphere is vital for irrigated agriculture and hydropower generation. An overlooked cryosphere component that is critical for this is aufeis, which appears as a sheet-like formation of ice layers, created by successive and laminated freezing of flowing water. This study aims to redress the lack of knowledge about this phenomenon by creating an inventory of aufeis fields for the UIB and analysing their spatial distribution, including the role of topographical parameters such as altitude, slope, and aspect. The study is based on a time-series analysis using Landsat imagery from 2010 to 2020, supported and validated by several field campaigns carried out between 2014 and 2020. In total, more than 3700 aufeis fields were detected covering an area of about 298 ± 38 km2. The spatial distribution of their occurrence indicates a distinct elevation range between 4000 and 5500 m a.s.l. and is marked by a pronounced longitudinal increase to the east. In contrast to the western part of the UIB (Gilgit-Baltistan), where only some few and small aufeis fields can be detected, 65% of the aufeis covered areas (195 ± 23 km2) exist on the Tibetan Plateau. Our database fills an important research gap and will help in further cryosphere studies in the UIB and beyond.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Brombierstäudl","given":"Dagmar"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Nüsser","given":"Marcus"}],"citation-key":"brombierstaudlDistributionRelevanceAufeis2021","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146604","ISSN":"0048-9697","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"146604","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Distribution and relevance of aufeis (icing) in the Upper Indus Basin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721016727","volume":"780"},

  {"id":"byersThreeRecentLesserKnown2022","abstract":"Glacial lake outburst floods, and specifically those triggered by avalanche-induced seiche waves, have been studied in considerable detail during the past several decades. Less attention has been given to other cryospheric flood phenomena, which include floods sourced primarily from englacial conduits, permafrost-linked rockfall and avalanches, and earthquake-triggered glacial lake floods. The article reviews examples of each phenomenon, based on field sampling and laboratory analyses, that have occurred in the Nepal Himalaya during the past decade, drawing parallels with similar events in other countries throughout the high mountain world. In most cases, the frequency of these events appears to be increasing globally, as is their potential to inflict significant damage downstream. We argue that each type of glacier flood requires more detailed study to develop the most effective prevention, mitigation, and adaptation approaches possible. Such studies will most likely be strengthened if they include a reconnaissance of the event as soon after its occurrence as possible, along with the participation, insights, and experience of local people, in addition to the use of increasingly powerful remote sensing technologies. How scientists can more quickly and effectively share the results of their research with decision-makers, and how decision-makers and governments can deliver more timely mitigation programs, are areas that also require further strengthening.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Byers","given":"Alton C."},{"family":"Shugar","given":"Dan H."},{"family":"Chand","given":"Mohan Bahadur"},{"family":"Portocarrero","given":"Cesar"},{"family":"Shrestha","given":"Milan"},{"family":"Rounce","given":"David R."},{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Teiji"}],"citation-key":"byersThreeRecentLesserKnown2022","container-title":"Mountain Research and Development","container-title-short":"mred","DOI":"10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-21-00045.1","ISSN":"0276-4741, 1994-7151","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5]]},"page":"A12-A22","source":"bioone.org","title":"Three Recent and Lesser-Known Glacier-Related Flood Mechanisms in High Mountain Environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bioone.org/journals/mountain-research-and-development/volume-42/issue-2/MRD-JOURNAL-D-21-00045.1/Three-Recent-and-Lesser-Known-Glacier-Related-Flood-Mechanisms-in/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-21-00045.1.full","volume":"42"},

The Ladakh region lies in the northernmost state of India, Jammu and Kashmir, in the Ladhak range. It has a unique cold-arid climate and lies immediately south of the Karakorum range. With scarce water resources, such regions show high sensitivity and vulnerability to the change in climate and need urgent attention. The objective of this study is to understand the climate of the Ladakh region and to characterize its changing climate. Using different temperature and precipitation datasets over Leh and surrounding regions, we statistically analyze the current trends of climatic patterns over the region. The study shows that the climate over Leh shows a warming trend with reduced precipitation in the current decade.

  {"id":"conwayCloudForcingSurface2022","abstract":"<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Clouds are an important component of the climate system, yet our understanding of how they directly and indirectly affect glacier melt in different climates is incomplete. Here we analyse high-quality datasets from 16 mountain glaciers in diverse climates around the globe to better understand how relationships between clouds and near-surface meteorology, radiation, and surface energy balance vary. The seasonal cycle of cloud frequency varies markedly between mountain glacier sites. During the main melt season at each site, an increase in cloud cover is associated with increased vapour pressure and relative humidity but relationships to wind speed are site-specific. At colder sites (average near-surface air temperature in melt season &lt; 0 &deg;C), air temperature generally increases with increasing cloudiness, while for warmer sites (average near-surface air temperature in melt season &gt;&gt; 0 &deg;C) air temperature decreases with increasing cloudiness. At all sites, surface melt is more frequent in cloudy compared to clear-sky conditions. The proportion of melt from temperature-dependent energy fluxes (incoming longwave radiation, turbulent sensible and latent heat) also universally increases in cloudy conditions. However, cloud cover does not affect daily total melt in a universal way, with some sites showing increased melt energy during cloudy conditions and others decreased melt energy. The complex association of clouds with melt energy is not amenable to simple relationships due to many interacting physical processes (varies with latitude, average melt-season air temperature, continentality, season, and elevation) but is most closely related to the effect of clouds on net radiation. These results motivate the use of physics-based surface energy balance models for representing glacier-climate relationships in regional- and global-scale assessments of glacier response to climate change.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Conway","given":"Jonathan P."},{"family":"Abermann","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Andreassen","given":"Liss M."},{"family":"Azam","given":"M.

Using a case study from the Himalayan village of Stongde in Zangskar (Northern India), current trends in land utilization, work patterns and livelihood strategies are presented and discussed. The assessment of persistence and change of land-use patterns and strategies over a period of almost three decades is based on a comparative analysis of Henry Osmaston's studies in the case study village in 1980 and recent field research by the authors. The study shows a high persistence of field structures fostered by a set of environmental, political and social factors. At the same time, the survey illustrates a diversification of the cropping pattern and recent agricultural trends. High mountain livelihoods are modified by a number of internal and external factors, including new agricultural practices, rural development initiatives, food subsidies and off-farm income.

Anhand einer vergleichenden Analyse von Henry Osmastons Arbeiten in der als Fallstudie ausgewählten Siedlung im Jahr 1980 und aktuellen Feldforschungsarbeiten der Autoren, werden Persistenz und Wandel der Landnutzungsmuster und -strategien über einen Zeitraum von knapp drei Jahrzehnten analysiert. Hierbei wird ein hoher Grad an Persistenz in den Feldstrukturen deutlich, der durch ein Zusammenspiel ökologischer, politischer und sozialer Faktoren begründet ist. Zugleich zeigt die Untersuchung eine Diversifizierung der Anbaufrüchte sowie aktuelle agrarwirtschaftliche Entwicklungen auf. Lebenssicherungsstrategien im Hochgebirge werden durch eine Vielzahl interner und externer Faktoren, zu denen neue landwirtschaftliche Praktiken, Entwicklungsprogramme, Subventionen von Grundnahrungsmitteln und außeragrarische Einkommensmöglichkeiten zählen, geprägt.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Dame","given":"Juliane"},{"family":"Mankelow","given":"J.

  {"id":"farhanHydrologicalRegimesConjunction2015","abstract":"In a changing climate, river basins with limited summer precipitation but abundant snow and glacier melt-water are affected severely by reductions and seasonal alterations in annual stream flows. However, high altitude glacio-hydrological observations and investigations to address the linkage between the timing of glacier changes and river runoff fluctuations remain ambiguous, particularly in the northwestern Himalayan region of Pakistan. In this context, the hydrological regime of the Astore Basin, a sub-catchment of the Upper Indus River Basin, was comprehensively investigated by employing in situ hydro-meteorological observations in combination with satellite remote sensing data. Two-thirds of the annual precipitation in the Astore Basin falls in winter and spring, mainly deposited by westerly winds, whereas summer and autumn precipitation deposited by the monsoon and local jet streams accounts for only one-third. Some 14 % of the basin area is covered by glaciers and, added to the accumulated seasonal snow deposited by westerly circulations, this can reach 80–85 % of the basin area. Therefore more than 75 % of the annual basin runoff depends on melt-water produced by the predominant seasonal snow and glacier ablation. The non-parametric Mann–Kendall trend test was applied to the whole time-series of hydro-meteorological data. This indicated a lowering of annual and summer mean temperatures during the period 1980–1995 and slight warming during the 1996–2010 period. Similarly, annual, winter and summer precipitation, and annual mean discharge, increased from 1980 to 1995 but, in contrast, a slight decrease in annual and summer precipitation was observed during the 1996–2010 period; however, discharge evidence is slight making any increase in this period insignificant. In addition, the Spearman and Mann–Kendall correlation results depict annual stream flow fluctuations during the 1980–2010 decades in the Astore River that were predominantly influenced by precipitation variations, but not by any alteration in catchment temperatures, and so not governed by enhanced glacier ablation and retreat. The results of the analysis presented here were also substantiated by satellite remote sensing investigation, which points to evidence of stable conditions in the Astore Basin glaciers during this period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Farhan","given":"Suhaib Bin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yinsheng"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yingzhao"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yanhong"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Ning"}],"citation-key":"farhanHydrologicalRegimesConjunction2015","container-title":"Climate Dynamics","container-title-short":"Clim Dyn","DOI":"10.1007/s00382-014-2409-9","ISSN":"1432-0894","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3015-3032","source":"Springer Link","title":"Hydrological regimes under the conjunction of westerly and monsoon climates: a case investigation in the Astore Basin, Northwestern Himalaya","title-short":"Hydrological regimes under the conjunction of westerly and monsoon climates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2409-9","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"fortesGISAREGGISBased2005","abstract":"To support improved irrigation scheduling in the Syr Darya basin, Uzbekistan, the ISAREG model was selected due to previous applications in similar climates. It is a conceptual non-distributed water balance model for simulating crop irrigation schedules at field level and to compute irrigation requirements under optimal and/or water stressed conditions. To provide for the use of the model at the project scale, a new version of the model, integrated with a Geographical Information System (GIS), was developed. This GIS based application is aimed at supporting the implementation of improved farm irrigation management and, in a later phase, to also help project management. The integration concerns the creation of spatial and weather GIS databases usable by ISAREG, the models operation for different water management scenarios, and the production of crop irrigation maps and time dependent irrigation depths at selected aggregation modes, including the farm scale. The resulting information on alternative irrigation schedules is, therefore, spatially distributed and shall be used both to support irrigation scheduling advising and to help in the identification of practices that may lead to water saving and provide for salinity control. The paper includes brief descriptions of the models, the databases and the integration of the models, as well as main features of the GISAREG application. Results relative to the comparative analysis of irrigation scheduling scenarios show the capabilities of the model to support the selection of water saving alternatives. The appropriateness of implementing 15–20-day time intervals between irrigations is shown. In addition, results relative to compare net irrigation requirements for wet and dry years show the usefulness of the model in handling time series of weather data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Fortes","given":"P.

  {"id":"furianProjected21stCenturyGlacial2022","abstract":"In High Mountain Asia (HMA), rising temperatures and retreating glaciers are leading to the formation of new glacial lakes and the expansion of existing ones. The sudden release of water from such lakes can lead to devastating glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) threatening people and infrastructure for many kilometers downstream. Therefore, information on future glacial lakes, e.g., their location, area and volume as well as the timing of their development, is vital for sustainable development of settlements and infrastructures. In this study, we present comprehensive estimates for future glacial lake development in HMA with unprecedented temporal resolution. We rely on an ensemble of fifteen global climate models using the newest CMIP6 data and employ a set of four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. With the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM), we use a modeling framework that explicitly simulates glacier dynamics in order to model glacier change until 2100 and estimate the formation period for each of the 2,700 largest future glacial lakes (>0.1 km2) in HMA. We estimate the glacial lake area in the entire region to grow by 474 ± 121 km2 for SSP126 and 833 ± 148 km2 for SSP585. Following recent estimates of currently existing glacial lakes (>0.1 km2), this would constitute an increase in lake area of ∼120–∼210% in 2100 compared to 2018. The lake volume is expected to increase by 22.8 ± 6.7 km3 for SSP126 and 39.7 ± 7.7 km3 for SSP585. This range includes a drastic tenfold increase in lake volume, from estimated 3.9 km3 in 2018 to 43.6 ± 7.7 km3 in 2100. However, there is a considerable spread between total and relative increase in glacial lake area and volume for different sub-regions of High Mountain Asia. As both, lake area and lake volume, could to lead to an increase in GLOF risk, the results emphasize the urgent need for more localized, in-depth studies at especially vulnerable locations in order to enable local communities to adapt to emerging challenges, to implement risk minimization measures, and to improve sustainable development in High Mountain Asia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Furian","given":"Wilhelm"},{"family":"Maussion","given":"Fabien"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"furianProjected21stCenturyGlacial2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","ISSN":"2296-6463","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Projected 21st-Century Glacial Lake Evolution in High Mountain Asia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feart.2022.821798","volume":"10"},

The models range from a simple degree-day model, based solely on air temperature, to more-sophisticated models, including the full shortwave radiation balance. In addition to the empirical models, the performance of a physically based energy-balance (EB) model is examined. The melt models are coupled to an accumulation and a surface evolution model and applied in a distributed manner to Rhonegletscher, Switzerland, over the period 1929–2012 at hourly resolution. For calibration, seasonal mass-balance measurements (2006–12) are used. Decadal ice volume changes for six periods in the years 1929–2012 serve for model validation. Over the period 2006–12, there are almost no differences in performance between the models, except for EB, which is less consistent with observations, likely due to lack of meteorological in situ data. However, simulations over the long term (1929–2012) reveal that models which include a separate term for shortwave radiation agree best with the observed ice volume changes, indicating that their melt relationships are robust in time and thus suitable for long-term modelling, in contrast to more empirical approaches that are oversensitive to temperature fluctuations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gabbi","given":"Jeannette"},{"family":"Carenzo","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Pellicciotti","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Bauder","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Funk","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"gabbiComparisonEmpiricalPhysically2014","container-title":"Journal of Glaciology","DOI":"10.3189/2014JoG14J011","ISSN":"0022-1430, 1727-5652","issue":"224","issued":{"literal":"2014/ed"},"language":"en","page":"1140-1154","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"A comparison of empirical and physically based glacier surface melt models for long-term simulations of glacier response","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/comparison-of-empirical-and-physically-based-glacier-surface-melt-models-for-longterm-simulations-of-glacier-response/A5B59C35537BBA2246C5A368545E4678","volume":"60"},

  {"id":"gurungClimateTopographicControls2017","abstract":"Snow governs interaction between atmospheric and land surface processes in high mountains, and is also source of fresh water. It is thus important to both climate scientists and local communities. However, our understanding of snow cover dynamics in terms of space and time is limited across the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region, which is known to be a climatically sensitive region. We used MODIS snow cover area (SCA) data (2003–2012), APHRODITE temperature data (2000–2007), and monthly long term in-situ river discharge data of the Gandaki (1968–2010), Koshi (1977–2010) and Manas (1987–2004) basins to analyse variations among four basins. We gained insights into short term SCA and temperature, long term discharge trends, and regional variability thereby. Strong correlations were observed among SCA, temperature and discharge thereby highlighting the strong nexus between them. Temporal and spatial snow cover variability across the basins is strongly coupled with the variability of two weather systems: Western Disturbances (WD) and Indian Monsoon System (IMS), and strongly influenced by topography. Manifestation of these variability in terms if downstream discharge can have repercussion to water based sectors: hydropower and agriculture, as low flow seasons is seen affected. This study adds to our knowledge of snow fall and melt dynamics in the HKH region, and intra-annual snow melt contributions to downstream discharges. The study is limited by short span of data and it is desirable to perform a similar study using data representing a much longer time span.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gurung","given":"Deo Raj"},{"family":"Maharjan","given":"Sudan Bikash"},{"family":"Shrestha","given":"Anu Bhalu"},{"family":"Shrestha","given":"Mandira Singh"},{"family":"Bajracharya","given":"Sagar Ratna"},{"family":"Murthy","given":"M.

  {"id":"haeberliFutureLakeDevelopment2022","abstract":"Continued retreat and disappearance of glaciers cause fundamental changes in cold mountain ranges and new landscapes to develop, and the consequences can reach far beyond the still ice-covered areas. A key element is the formation of numerous new lakes where overdeepened parts of glacier beds become exposed. With the first model results from the Swiss Alps around 2010 of distributed glacier thicknesses over entire mountain regions, the derivation of glacier beds as potential future surface topographies became possible. Since then, climate-, water-, and hazard-related quantitative research about future lakes in deglaciating mountains all over the world rapidly evolved.\n\nCurrently growing and potential future open water bodies are part of new environments in marked imbalance. The surrounding steep icy slopes and peaks are affected by glacial debuttressing and permafrost degradation, with associated long-term stability reduction. This makes the new lakes potential sources of far-reaching floods or debris flows, and they represent serious multipliers of hazards and risks to down-valley humans and their infrastructure. Such hazard and risk aspects are also of primary importance where the lakes potentially connect with hydropower production, freshwater supply, tourism, cultural values, and landscape protection.\n\nPlanning for sustainable adaptation strategies optimally starts from the anticipation in space and time of possible lake formation in glacier-covered areas by numerical modeling combined with analyses of ice-morphological indications. In a second step, hazards and risks related to worst-case scenarios of possible impact and flood waves must be assessed. These results then define the range of possibilities for use and management of future lakes. Careful weighing of both potential synergies and conflicts is necessary. In some cases, multipurpose projects may open viable avenues for combining solutions related to technical challenges, safety requirements, funding problems, and societal acceptance. Successful implementation of adaptive projects requires early integration of technical-scientific and local knowledge, including the needs and interests of local users and decision makers, into comprehensive, participatory, and long-term planning. A key question is the handling of risks from extreme events with disastrous damage potential and low but increasing probability of occurrence.\n\nAs future landscapes and lakes develop rapidly and are of considerable socioeconomic and political interest, they present often difficult and complex situations for which solutions must be found soon. Related transdisciplinary work will need to adequately address the sociocultural, economic, and political aspects.","author":[{"family":"Haeberli","given":"Wilfried"},{"family":"Drenkhan","given":"Fabian"}],"citation-key":"haeberliFutureLakeDevelopment2022","DOI":"10.1093/acrefore/9780199389407.013.361","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,24]]},"page":"1-45","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Future Lake Development in Deglaciating Mountain Ranges","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"hagenClimateChangerelatedRisks2022","abstract":"Climate-related risks in Central and South America have received increased attention and concern in science and policy, but an up-to-date comprehensive review and synthesis of risks and adaptation potential is currently missing. For this paper we evaluated over 200 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents published since 2012. We found that climate change in Central and South America during the 21st century may increase the risk to severe levels for the following topical risk clusters: (a) Food insecurity; (b) Floods and landslides; (c) Water scarcity; (d) Epidemics of vector-borne diseases; (e) Amazon Forest biome shift; (f). Coral bleaching; (g) Coastal risks of sea level rise, storm surges and erosion; (h) Systemic failure due to cascading impacts of hazards and epidemics. Our synthesis also identified feasible adaptation measures for each risk. The impacts of the risks will be heterogeneous throughout the region, with rural communities, Indigenous peoples, Afro-Latin Americans, women, disabled people, and migrants identified as being the most severely affected. We refer to a number of adaptation options for each risk. However, unabated climate change together with low adaptive capacity will strictly limit adaptation options. Immediate strengthening of policies for building adaptive capacity and increase of research on the risk-adaptation nexus in Central and South America are paramount. Our findings might contribute to guide the adjustment and emphasis of adaptation policies and climate risk management strategies from local to national level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Hagen","given":"I."},{"family":"Huggel","given":"C."},{"family":"Ramajo","given":"L."},{"family":"Chacón","given":"N."},{"family":"Ometto","given":"J.

While the current snow cover distribution on the slopes is often well known thanks to the usage of advanced monitoring techniques, information about its future evolution is usually lacking. Management-enabled numerical snowpack models driven by meteorological forecasts can help to fill this gap. In the frame of the H2020 project PROSNOW, the snowpack models AMUNDSEN, Crocus, and SNOWPACK/Alpine3D are applied in nine pilot ski resorts across the European Alps for forecasting snow conditions in time scales from days to several months ahead. We present the integration of detailed snowmaking and grooming practices implemented in the three models and show how they can be adapted to individual ski resorts. An ensemble of snow management configurations accounting for a comprehensive set of possible tactical and strategic operational choices is introduced, along with an approach to homogeneously spatialize the results of the three snow models over different areas of the ski resorts.

  {"id":"hockTemperatureIndexMelt2003","abstract":"Temperature index or degree-day models rest upon a claimed relationship between snow or ice melt and air temperature usually expressed in the form of positive temperatures. Since air temperature generally is the most readily available data, such models have been the most widely used method of ice and snow melt computations for many purposes, such as hydrological modelling, ice dynamic modelling or climate sensitivity studies. Despite their simplicity, temperature-index models have proven to be powerful tools for melt modelling, often on a catchment scale outperforming energy balance models. However, two shortcomings are evident: (1) although working well over long time periods their accuracy decreases with increasing temporal resolution; (2) spatial variability cannot be modelled accurately as melt rates may vary substantially due to topographic effects such as shading, slope and aspect angles. These effects are particularly crucial in mountain areas. This paper provides an overview of temperature-index methods, including glacier environments, and discusses recent advances on distributed approaches attempting to account for topographic effects in complex terrain, while retaining scarcity of data input. In the light of an increasing demand for melt estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution, such approaches need further refinement and development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hock","given":"Regine"}],"citation-key":"hockTemperatureIndexMelt2003","collection-title":"Mountain Hydrology and Water Resources","container-title":"Journal of Hydrology","container-title-short":"Journal of Hydrology","DOI":"10.1016/S0022-1694(03)00257-9","ISSN":"0022-1694","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,11,10]]},"language":"en","page":"104-115","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Temperature index melt modelling in mountain areas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169403002579","volume":"282"},

  {"id":"horiInsituMeasuredSpectral2006","abstract":"The directional emissivity of snow and ice surfaces in the 8–14 μm thermal infrared (TIR) atmospheric window was determined from spectral radiances obtained by field measurements using a portable Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in conjunction with snow pit work. The dependence of the directional emissivity on the surface snow type (grain size and shape) was examined. We obtained emissivity spectra for five different surface types, i.e., fine dendrite snow, medium granular snow, coarse grain snow, welded sun crust snow, and smooth bare ice. The derived emissivities show a distinct spectral contrast at wavelengths λ=10.5–12.5 μm which is enhanced with increasing the snow grain size. For example, emissivities at both 10.5 μm and 12.5 μm for the nadir angle were 0.997 and 0.984 for the fine dendrite snow, 0.996 and 0.974 for the medium granular snow, 0.995 and 0.971 for the coarse grain snow, 0.992 and 0.968 for the sun crust, and 0.993 and 0.949 for the bare ice, respectively. In addition, the spectral contrast exhibits a strong angular dependence, particularly for the coarser snow and bare ice, e.g., the emissivity at λ=12.5 μm for the off-nadir angle of 75° reaches down to 0.927, 0.896, and 0.709 for the coarse grain snow, sun crust, and bare ice cases, respectively. The angular dependent emissivity spectra of the bare ice were quite consistent with the spectra predicted by the Fresnel reflectance theory. The observed results firmly demonstrate that the directional emissivity of snow in the TIR can vary depending upon the surface snow type. The high variability of the spectral emissivity of snow also suggests the possibility to discriminate between snow and ice types from space using the brightness temperature difference in the atmospheric window.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hori","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Aoki","given":"Teruo"},{"family":"Tanikawa","given":"Tomonori"},{"family":"Motoyoshi","given":"Hiroki"},{"family":"Hachikubo","given":"Akihiro"},{"family":"Sugiura","given":"Konosuke"},{"family":"Yasunari","given":"Teppei J."},{"family":"Eide","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Storvold","given":"Rune"},{"family":"Nakajima","given":"Yukinori"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Fumihiro"}],"citation-key":"horiInsituMeasuredSpectral2006","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2005.11.001","ISSN":"0034-4257","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,2,28]]},"language":"en","page":"486-502","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"In-situ measured spectral directional emissivity of snow and ice in the 8–14 μm atmospheric window","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425705003974","volume":"100"},

Here, we present a new model for calculating the twenty-first century mass changes of all glaciers on Earth outside the ice sheets. The Global Glacier Evolution Model (GloGEM) includes mass loss due to frontal ablation at marine-terminating glacier fronts and accounts for glacier advance/retreat and surface elevation changes. Simulations are driven with monthly near-surface air temperature and precipitation from 14 Global Circulation Models forced by RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Depending on the scenario, the model yields a global glacier volume loss of 25–48% between 2010 and 2100. For calculating glacier contribution to sea-level rise, we account for ice located below sea-level presently displacing ocean water. This effect reduces the glacier contribution by 11–14%, so that our model predicts a sea-level equivalent (multi-model mean ±1 standard deviation) of 79±24 mm (RCP2.6), 108±28 mm (RCP4.5), and 157±31 mm (RCP8.5). Mass losses by frontal ablation account for 10% of total ablation globally, and up to ~30% regionally. Regional equilibrium line altitudes are projected to rise by ~100–800 m until 2100, but the effect on ice wastage depends on initial glacier hypsometries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Huss","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Hock","given":"Regine"}],"citation-key":"hussNewModelGlobal2015","container-title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","ISSN":"2296-6463","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"A new model for global glacier change and sea-level rise","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feart.2015.00054","volume":"3"},

To circumvent the lack of ground based measurements, models can be applied to estimate solar irradiance components. A fundamental component is clear sky irradiance. In particular, clear sky irradiance is used as the normalization function in models that convert meteorological satellite images into irradiance, or in models that decompose global irradiance into diffuse/direct fraction. It is therefore important to evaluate and validate clear sky irradiance models. This paper presents the results of a validation of hourly clear sky models spanning up to eight years. The validation relies on high quality measurements at 22 locations in Europe and around the Mediterranean region. Seven models are evaluated. They were selected on the basis of their published performance, their simplicity of use, and/or their computational speed; two different sources of the aerosol load are used as input to the models. The three best models show a low bias and a standard deviation ranging from ±3% to ±5%. The standard deviation of the bias across the 22 locations is of the same order of magnitude. The observed bias patterns can be largely traced to inaccuracies inherent to the sources aerosol optical depth. No particular seasonal effects are noted. A consistent limitation across all selected models, even if their direct irradiance performance can be judged satisfactory based on the standard deviation metric, is that they tend to fall short of observations for a given clear sky global clearness index value.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Ineichen","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"ineichenValidationModelsThat2016","container-title":"Solar Energy","container-title-short":"Solar Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.solener.2016.03.017","ISSN":"0038-092X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"332-344","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Validation of models that estimate the clear sky global and beam solar irradiance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X16002048","volume":"132"},

  {"id":"kneibSubseasonalVariabilitySupraglacial2022","abstract":"<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> Melt from supraglacial ice cliffs is an important contributor to the mass loss of debris-covered glaciers. However, ice cliff contribution is difficult to quantify as they are highly dynamic features, and the paucity of observations of melt rates and their variability leads to large modeling uncertainties. We quantify monsoon season melt and 3D evolution of four ice cliffs over two debris-covered glaciers in High Mountain Asia (Langtang Glacier, Nepal, and 24 K Glacier, Tibet) at very high resolution using terrestrial photogrammetry applied to imagery captured from time-lapse cameras installed on lateral moraines. We derive weekly flow-corrected DEMs of the glacier surface with an estimated uncertainty of +/- 0.2 m for Langtang Glacier and +/- 0.06 m for 24 K Glacier and use change detection to determine distributed melt rates at the surfaces of the ice cliffs throughout the study period. We compare the measured melt patterns with those derived from a 3D energy balance model to derive the contribution of the main energy fluxes. We find that ice cliff melt varies considerably throughout the melt season, with maximum melt rates of 5 to 8 cm.day<sup>-1</sup>, which is 3 to 38 times higher than the melt rates of the surrounding debris-covered ice. Our results highlight the influence of redistributed supraglacial debris on cliff melt. At both sites, ice cliff albedo is influenced by the presence of thin debris at the ice cliff surface, which is largely controlled on 24 K Glacier by liquid precipitation events that wash away this debris. Slightly thicker or patchy debris reduces melt by 1&ndash;2 cm.day<sup>-</sup>1 at all sites. Ultimately, our observations show a strong variability in cliff area, which is controlled by supraglacial streams and ponds and englacial cavities that promote debris slope destabilization and the lateral expansion of the cliffs. These findings highlight the need to better represent processes of debris redistribution in ice cliff models, to in turn improve estimates of ice cliff contribution to glacier melt and the long-term geomorphological evolution of debris-covered glacier surfaces.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kneib","given":"Marin"},{"family":"Miles","given":"Evan S."},{"family":"Buri","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Fugger","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"McCarthy","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Thomas E."},{"family":"Chuanxi","given":"Zhao"},{"family":"Truffer","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Westoby","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Pellicciotti","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"kneibSubseasonalVariabilitySupraglacial2022","container-title":"The Cryosphere Discussions","DOI":"10.5194/tc-2022-81","ISSN":"1994-0416","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"language":"English","page":"1-44","source":"tc.copernicus.org","title":"Sub-seasonal variability of supraglacial ice cliff melt rates and associated processes from time-lapse photogrammetry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2022-81/?s=09"},

Drängende Forschungsfragen der Gegenwart erfordern vermehrt eine fächerübergreifende Zusammenarbeit vor allem dann, wenn die Überlebensbedingungen der Hochgebirgsbevölkerung in einer risikoreichen Umwelt bei knapper werdenden Ressourcen thematisiert werden. Unterschiedliche methodische Herangehensweisen einzelner Teildisziplinen stellen ein prinzipielles Problem natur- und sozialwissenschaftlicher Kooperation dar. Trotz dieser strukturellen Unterschiedlichkeit und inkongruenter theoretischer Vorgehensweise bieten sich in Schlüsselfragen der Mensch-Umwelt-Beziehungen thematische Überschneidungsbereiche an. Bestimmte Problemfelder lassen sich ohne fächerübergreifende Kooperation nicht mehr hinreichend bearbeiten. Aus dieser Gemeinsamkeit lassen sich Forschungsfelder extrahieren, in denen Entwicklungsprobleme in Hochgebirgsräumen der Dritten Welt thematisiert werden. Unter Berücksichtigung international angewandter Indikatoren zur Abschätzung des Entwicklungsstandes kristallisieren sich Schlüsselgrößen heraus, die eine zweifache Relevanz besitzen: Sie stellen ein mögliches Instrumentarium zur Messung regionaler Disparitäten bereit und geben eine zukünftige Orientierung von Problemstellungen vor. Dabei können in verschiedenen Sektoren Entwicklungsdefizite und Verteilungsungleichheiten in peripheren Regionen festgemacht werden. Unter Berücksichtigung einer derartigen Projektion auf Hochgebirgsgesellschaften wird Handlungsbedarf in den folgenden fächerübergreifend zu bearbeitenden Teilbereichen ausgemacht: Siedlungsterritorien und Bevölkerung, Wirtschaft und Ernährung, Ressourcenmanagement und Energieversorgung. Die dafür nötigen methodischen Instrumente zur Identifizierung von Entwicklungsproblemen liegen vor und bieten bei angemessener Anwendung die Chance zum überregionalen Vergleich.

The pressing research questions of our time increasingly require multi- or interdisciplinary co-operation, especially in situations where the theme is one of the deteriorating living conditions of the high mountain population with fewer resources in an environment fraught with risks. Different methods of approach of particular sub-disciplines present a fundamental problem of co-operation among the natural and the social sciences. In spite of these structural differences and incongruent theoretical approaches, common thematic areas occur in key questions concerning relations between man and his environment. Some problem areas can no longer be adequately tackled without interdisciplinary co-operation. This common purpose permits the identification of research areas which take development problems in high mountain areas of the Third World as their theme. Taking into account internationally applied indicators for the appraisal of the level of development, key parameters emerge which prove to be of two-fold relevance: they provide a potential set of instruments for the assessment of regional disparities, as well as a future orientation for the approach to the problems. This allows development deficits and distributional inequalities in peripheral regions to be established for several sectors. Working with this kind of projection onto high mountain societies, a need for interdisciplinary action is identified in the following branches: settlement area and population, economy and nutrition, resource management and energy supply. The necessary methodological instruments for the identification of development problems are available, and with appropriate application they offer the opportunity of supra-regional comparison. The example of water utilization in arid high mountain regions serves to demonstrate the approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Kreutzmann","given":"Hermann"}],"citation-key":"kreutzmannWaterTowersMankind1998","container-title":"Erdkunde","ISSN":"0014-0015","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"page":"185-200","publisher":"Erdkunde","source":"JSTOR","title":"From Water Towers of Mankind to Livelihood Strategies of Mountain Dwellers: Approaches and Perspectives for High Mountain Research (Von den \"Wassertürmen der Menschheit\" zu bergbäuerlichen Überlebensstrategien: Ansätze und Perspektiven für die Hochgebirgsforschung)","title-short":"From Water Towers of Mankind to Livelihood Strategies of Mountain Dwellers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25647057","volume":"52"},

The number of human-designed algorithms for the estimation of TCC grows every year. However, there has been no considerable progress in terms of quality, mostly due to the lack of systematic approach to the design of the algorithms, to the assessment of their generalization ability, and to the assessment of the TCC retrieval quality. In this study, we discuss the optimization nature of data-driven schemes for TCC retrieval. In order to compare the algorithms, we propose a framework for the assessment of the algorithms&rsquo; characteristics. We present several new algorithms that are based on deep learning techniques: A model for outliers filtering, and a few models for TCC retrieval from all-sky imagery. For training and assessment of data-driven algorithms of this study, we present the Dataset of All-Sky Imagery over the Ocean (DASIO) containing over one million all-sky optical images of the visible sky dome taken in various regions of the world ocean. The research campaigns that contributed to the DASIO collection took place in the Atlantic ocean, the Indian ocean, the Red and Mediterranean seas, and the Arctic ocean. Optical imagery collected during these missions are accompanied by standard meteorological observations of cloudiness characteristics made by experienced observers. We assess the generalization ability of the presented models in several scenarios that differ in terms of the regions selected for the train and test subsets. As a result, we demonstrate that our models based on convolutional neural networks deliver a superior quality compared to all previously published approaches. As a key result, we demonstrate a considerable drop in the ability to generalize the training data in the case of a strong covariate shift between the training and test subsets of imagery which may occur in the case of region-aware subsampling.","author":[{"family":"Krinitskiy","given":"Mikhail"},{"family":"Aleksandrova","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Verezemskaya","given":"Polina"},{"family":"Gulev","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Sinitsyn","given":"Alexey"},{"family":"Kovaleva","given":"Nadezhda"},{"family":"Gavrikov","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"krinitskiyGeneralizationAbilityDataDriven2021","container-title":"Remote Sensing 2021, Vol. 13, Page 326","DOI":"10.3390/RS13020326","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"page":"326","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"On the Generalization Ability of Data-Driven Models in the Problem of Total Cloud Cover Retrieval","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/2/326/htm https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/2/326","volume":"13"},

The model requires inputs of surface short-wave radiation and long-wave radiation or total cloud cover fraction (TC). Long-wave radiation is often not measured directly so a method to determine TC from commonly measured short-wave solar irradiance (E0) and theoretical short-wave solar irradiance under a clear sky (Ec) has broad application. A more than 17-year (15 November 1991 to 20 February 2009) hourly solar irradiance data set was used to estimate the peak solar irradiance for each ordinal date over one year, which was assumed to be representative of solar irradiance in the absence of cloud. Comparison between these daily observed values and the modelled clear-sky solar radiation over one year was in close agreement (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.995 and root mean squared error, RMSE = 12.54 W m-2). The downloaded hourly cloudiness measurements from 15 November 1991 to 20 February 2009 was used to calculate the daily values for this period and then the calculated daily values over the 17 years were used to calculate the average values for each ordinal date over one year. A regression equation between (1 - E0/Ec) and TC produced a correlation coefficient value of 0.99 (p > 0.01, n = 71). The validation of this cloud cover estimation model was conducted with observed short-wave solar radiation and TC at two sites. Values of TC derived from the model at the Lake Rotorua site gave a reasonable prediction of the observed values (RMSE = 0.10, r = 0.86, p > 0.01, n = 61). The model was also tested at Queenstown (South Island of New Zealand) and it provided satisfactory results compared to the measurements (RMSE = 0.16, r = 0.67, p > 0.01, n = 61).

  {"id":"majeedSpatiotemporalDynamicsGeodetic2021","abstract":"Glaciers across the Himalayan arc are showing varying signs of recession. Glaciers in the eastern and western parts of the Himalayan arc are retreating more rapidly as compared to other regions. This differential retreat is often attributed to climatic, topographic, and geologic influences. The glaciers in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh are believed to be relatively stable as compared to other parts of the western Himalaya. The present study ascertained the area changes and frontal retreat of 87 glaciers in the Pangong Region between 1990 and 2019 using satellite data. The geodetic mass changes were also assessed using SRTM and TanDEM-X digital elevation models of 2000 and 2012 respectively. Besides, the glacier outlines were delineated manually and compared with existing regional and global glacier inventories that are available over the region. The GlabTop model was used to simulate the glacier-bed overdeepenings of four glaciers that are associated with a proglacial lake. The study also analyzed the impact of topographic influences and varying debris cover on glacier recession. This analysis indicated deglaciation of 6.7 ± 0.1% (0.23% a−1) from 1990 to 2019 over the Pangong Region with clean-ice glaciers showing a higher retreat (8.4 ± 0.28%) compared to the debris-covered glaciers (5.7 ± 0.14%). However, the overall recession is lower compared to other parts of northwestern Himalayas. The glacier recession showed a positive correlation with mean glacier slope (r = 0.3) and debris cover (r = 0.1) with bigger size glaciers having retreated at a lesser pace compared to smaller ones. This underpins the need for in-situ data about debris thickness to precisely ascertain the role of debris on glacier recession in the Trans-Himalayan Ladakh where debris thickness data is absent. The mean glacier elevation did not indicate any influence on glacier recession. From 2000 to 12, the glaciers lost an ice mass amounting to 0.33 ± 0.05 m we. per year. The formation of four new proglacial lakes, although small (<6 ha), need to be monitored using remote sensing data while the infrastructure development activities should not be permitted given glacial lake outburst flood risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Majeed","given":"Ulfat"},{"family":"Rashid","given":"Irfan"},{"family":"Najar","given":"Nadeem Ahmad"},{"family":"Gul","given":"Nafeeza"}],"citation-key":"majeedSpatiotemporalDynamicsGeodetic2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","ISSN":"2296-6463","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Geodetic Mass Changes of Glaciers With Varying Debris Cover in the Pangong Region of Trans-Himalayan Ladakh, India Between 1990 and 2019","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feart.2021.748107","volume":"9"},

Analysis of surface energy balance (SEB) at the glacier surface is the most comprehensive way to explain the atmosphere-glacier interactions but that requires extensive data. In this study, we analyse an 11-year (2009–2020) record of the meteorological dataset from an automatic weather station installed at 4863 m a.s.l., on a lateral moraine of the Chhota Shigri Glacier in the western Himalaya. The study was carried out over the winter months (December to April) to understand SEB drivers and snow sublimation. Further, we examine the role of cloud cover on SEB and turbulent heat fluxes. The turbulent heat fluxes were calculated using the bulk-aerodynamic method, including stability corrections. The net short-wave radiation was the primary energy source. However, the turbulent heat fluxes dissipated a significant amount of energy. The cloud cover plays an important role in limiting the incoming short-wave radiation by 70 %. It also restricts the turbulent heat fluxes by around 50 %, consequently less snow sublimation. During the winter period, turbulent latent heat flux contributed the largest (63 %) in the total SEB, followed by net all-wave radiation (29 %) and sensible heat flux (8 %). Sublimation rates were three times higher in clear-sky conditions than overcast, indicating a strong control of cloud cover in turbulent latent heat flux. Dry air, along with the high snow surface temperature and wind speed, favours sublimation. We also observed that strong and cold winds, possibly through mid-latitude western disturbances, impede sublimation by bringing high moisture content in the region and cooling the snow surface. The estimated snow sublimation fraction was 16–42 % of the total winter snowfall at the study site. This indicates snow sublimation is an essential parameter to be considered in the glaciohydrological modelling at the high mountain Himalayan catchments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Mandal","given":"Arindan"},{"family":"Angchuk","given":"Thupstan"},{"family":"Azam","given":"Mohd Farooq"},{"family":"Ramanathan","given":"Alagappan"},{"family":"Wagnon","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Soheb","given":"Mohd"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Chetan"}],"citation-key":"mandal11yearRecordWintertime2022","DOI":"10.5194/tc-2021-386","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]]},"publisher":"Snow/Energy Balance Obs/Modelling","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"11-year record of wintertime snow surface energy balance and sublimation at 4863 m a.s.l. on Chhota Shigri Glacier moraine (western Himalaya, India)","type":"report","URL":"https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2021-386/"},
  {"id":"martinezWaterUseEfficiency2014","abstract":"In semiarid regions where water resources are scarce, irrigation water use efficiency is an important issue. Although subsurface drip irrigation is a very efficient irrigation method, it has had relatively limited expansion due to several disadvantages such as the clogging of emitters and the difficulty of detecting leakages and repairing them. Recently, an alternative subsurface irrigation method that is able to avoid most of the aforementioned drawbacks has been introduced in southern Spain. The objective of this work is to assess the performance of this method and to compare it to a surface drip-irrigation system. To achieve this objective, a three-year field experiment was carried out in an organic olive orchard (Olea europaea L.) located in the province of Almería, Spain. The water-use efficiency of both irrigation methods was analyzed under three different irrigation water supplies. The results show that the alternative subsurface irrigation method seems to perform better than the drip irrigation one because the yield and the irrigation water use efficiency were higher for the first one.

  {"id":"matthewsGoingExtremesInstalling2020","abstract":"As the highest mountain on Earth, Mount Everest is an iconic peak that offers an unrivalled natural platform for measuring ongoing climate change across the full elevation range of Asia’s water towers. However, Everest’s extreme environment challenges data collection, particularly on the mountain’s upper slopes, where glaciers accumulate mass and mountaineers are most exposed. Weather stations have operated on Everest before, including the world’s previous highest, but coverage has been sparse in space and time. Here we describe the installation of a network of five automatic weather stations (AWSs), including the two highest stations on Earth (8,430 m.a.s.l and 7,945 m.a.s.l) which greatly improves monitoring of this iconic mountain. We highlight sample applications of the new data, including an initial assessment of surface energy fluxes at Camp II (6,464 m.a.s.l) and the South Col (7,945 m.a.s.l), which suggest melt occurs at both sites, despite persistently below-freezing air temperatures. This analysis indicates that melt may even be possible at the 8,850 m.a.s.l summit, and prompts a reevaluation of empirical temperature index models used to simulate glacier melt in the Himalaya that focus only on air temperature. We also provide the first evaluation of numerical weather forecasts at almost 8,000 m.a.s.l and use of model output statistics to reduce forecast error, showcasing an important opportunity to improve climber safety on Everest. Looking forward, we emphasize the considerable potential of these freely available data for understanding weather and climate in the Himalaya and beyond, including tracking the behavior of upper-atmosphere winds, which the AWS network is uniquely positioned to monitor.","author":[{"family":"Matthews","given":"T."},{"family":"Perry","given":"L.

  {"id":"matthewsLatentHeatMust","abstract":"Anthropogenic forcing is driving energy accumulation in the Earth system, including increases in the sensible heat content of the atmosphere, as measured by dry-bulb temperature—the metric that is almost universally used for communications about climate change. The atmosphere is also moistening, though, representing an accumulation of latent heat, which is partly concealed by dry-bulb temperature trends. We highlight that, consistent with basic theory, latent heat gains are outpacing sensible heat gains over about half of the Earth's surface. The difference is largest in the tropics, where global “hotspots” of total heat accumulation are located, and where regional disparities in heating rates are very poorly represented by dry-bulb temperatures. Including latent heat in climate-change metrics captures this heat accumulation and therefore improves adaptation-relevant understanding of the extreme humid heat and precipitation hazards that threaten these latitudes so acutely. For example, irrigation can lower peak dry-bulb temperatures, but amplify latent heat content by a larger margin, intensifying dangerous heat stress. Based on a review of the research literature, our Perspective therefore calls for routine use of equivalent temperature, a measure that expresses the combined sensible and latent heat content of the atmosphere in the familiar units of °C or K. We recognize that dry-bulb air temperature must remain a key indicator of the atmospheric state, not least for the many sectors that are sensitive to sensible heat transfer. However, we assert here that more widespread use of equivalent temperature could improve process understanding, public messaging, and adaptation to climate change.

  {"id":"meinshausenRealizationParisAgreement2022","abstract":"Over the last five years prior to the Glasgow Climate Pact1, 154 Parties have submitted new or updated 2030 mitigation goals in their nationally determined contributions and 76 have put forward longer-term pledges. Quantifications of the pledges before the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) suggested a less than 50 per cent chance of keeping warming below 2 degrees Celsius2–5. Here we show that warming can be kept just below 2 degrees Celsius if all conditional and unconditional pledges are implemented in full and on time. Peak warming could be limited to 1.9–2.0 degrees Celsius (5%–95% range 1.4–2.8 °C) in the full implementation case—building on a probabilistic characterization of Earth system uncertainties in line with the Working Group I contribution to the&nbsp;Sixth Assessment Report6 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We retrospectively project twenty-first-century warming to show how the aggregate level of ambition changed from 2015 to 2021. Our results rely on the extrapolation of time-limited targets beyond 2030 or 2050, characteristics of the IPCC 1.5 °C Special Report (SR1.5) scenario database7 and the full implementation of pledges. More pessimistic assumptions on these factors would lead to higher temperature projections. A second, independent emissions modelling framework projected peak warming of 1.8 degrees Celsius, supporting the finding that realized pledges could limit warming to just below 2 degrees Celsius. Limiting warming not only to ‘just below’ but to ‘well below’ 2 degrees Celsius or 1.5 degrees Celsius urgently requires policies and actions to bring about steep emission reductions this decade, aligned with mid-century global net-zero CO2 emissions. If all new and updated national climate change mitigation pledges stemming from the Paris Agreement are implemented in full and on time, then 21st-century warming could be limited to just below 2 degrees Celsius.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Meinshausen","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Jared"},{"family":"McGlade","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Gütschow","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Nicholls","given":"Zebedee"},{"family":"Burdon","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Cozzi","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Hackmann","given":"Bernd"}],"citation-key":"meinshausenRealizationParisAgreement2022","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-022-04553-z","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7905","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4]]},"language":"en","page":"304-309","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Realization of Paris Agreement pledges may limit warming just below 2 °C","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04553-z","volume":"604"},

However, little is known about the interplay of multiple climatic and non-climatic stressors and related processes driving water resource changes. We developed an integrated model that analyzes different trajectories of water availability including hydro-climatic (water supply) and socio-economic (water demand) variables with consistent multi-descriptor future scenarios until 2050.\nNew hydrological insights for the region\nAt the lower-basin outflow of Condorcerro, mean annual water availability is projected to increase by 10% ± 12% by 2050. This gain is mainly driven by an increase in annual precipitation amounts of about 14% (RCP2.6) and 18% (RCP8.5), respectively, which was computed using a global climate multi-model ensemble. In contrast, mean dry-season water availability is projected to substantially decrease by 33% and 36% ( ± 24%) by 2050, for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. This decline is driven by a combination of diminishing glacier discharge and increasing water demand both of which adopt a major role in the absence of considerable precipitation inputs. These seasonal differences highlight the need to adequately consider spatiotemporal scales within multi-scenario water balance models to support local decision-making. Our results elucidate the need for improvements in water management and infrastructure to counteract diminishing dry-season water availability and to reduce future risks of water scarcity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Motschmann","given":"Alina"},{"family":"Teutsch","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Huggel","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Seidel","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"León","given":"Christian D."},{"family":"Muñoz","given":"Randy"},{"family":"Sienel","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Drenkhan","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Weimer-Jehle","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"motschmannCurrentFutureWater2022","container-title":"Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies","container-title-short":"Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101063","ISSN":"2214-5818","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"101063","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Current and future water balance for coupled human-natural systems – Insights from a glacierized catchment in Peru","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581822000763","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015","abstract":"The hydrograph separation method, previously proposed to quantify base flow, seasonal snowmelt, and glacial melt components in river flows within Upper Indus basin underestimates glacial melt component. This is particularly limiting for highly glacierized watersheds. The limitation has been corrected by a further refinement of the method. The results with the refined procedure are highly consistent with the physical characteristics such as hypsometry and glacier extents of the watershed even though the method itself is completely independent of the physical characteristics of the watershed where it is applied. Glacial melt far outweigh snowmelt in the rivers draining the Karakoram and Zanskar ranges. In the Karakoram, on an annualized basis, glacial melt proportion varies from 43% to 50% whereas snowmelt varies from 27% to 31%. On the other hand, snowmelt dominates over glacial melt in the rivers draining the western Greater Himalayas and the Hindu Kush. Here snowmelt percentage in river discharge varies from 31% to 53% whereas that of glacial melt ranges from 16% to 30%. In the main stem of Upper Indus River, snowmelt fraction in most cases is slightly greater than the glacial melt fraction. In the main stem, snowmelt percentage ranges from 35% to 44% whereas glacial melt percentage ranges from 25% to 36%. Upper Indus River just upstream of Tarbela Reservoir carries annual flows constituted of 70% melt water of which 26% is contributed by glacial melts and 44% by snowmelts. We also show that during the later part of twentieth century and continuing into the early part of twenty first century glacial melt contributions to river discharge has decreased compared to the previous decades. This phenomenon can be ascribed to either basin wide loss of glacial mass in the recent decades in the elevation range from where most of the glacial melt originates or glacier growth and stability due to either reduction in energy inputs or increase in precipitation or both at the high altitude bands wherefrom glacial melt water originates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Mukhopadhyay","given":"Biswajit"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Asif"}],"citation-key":"mukhopadhyayReevaluationSnowmeltGlacial2015","container-title":"Journal of Hydrology","container-title-short":"Journal of Hydrology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.04.045","ISSN":"0022-1694","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"119-132","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A reevaluation of the snowmelt and glacial melt in river flows within Upper Indus Basin and its significance in a changing climate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415003042","volume":"527"},

High aridity and low temperature lead to sparse vegetation. Ladakhi farmers have always been dependent on snow and glacier melt water, but the climate change experienced in the last four decades poses a threat for the future. There are different engineering solutions as integral part of water shed management: diversion canal, water reservoir, gravity canal, lift irrigation scheme, and snow harvesting. Only 10–15 % of Ladakhi agriculture benefits from the Indus and Shayok, while the remaining is entirely dependent on snowmelt streams and traditional water management systems of the watershed areas in the cold desert of Ladakh. The system of water distribution during the farming season is strictly followed by the people in their respective villages. Artificial glacier technique is used in the area from 1987. The main stream water is diverted by constructing a long channel made of dry stonewall across the hill slopes to the glacier site. The length, breadth and depth of the channel vary with the slope of the hill as well as an estimated flow of the stream. Dry stone retaining walls and a suitable bed grade to smoothen the follow of water protect the channel from damage. The stone wall is made of locally available stone and a mix of organic manure and soft soil. The technology of the artificial glacier has been in operation in the area for 15 years and is performing successfully.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Norphel","given":"Chewang"},{"family":"Tashi","given":"Padma"}],"citation-key":"norphelSnowWaterHarvesting2015","collection-title":"Disaster Risk Reduction","container-title":"Mountain Hazards and Disaster Risk Reduction","DOI":"10.1007/978-4-431-55242-0_11","editor":[{"family":"Nibanupudi","given":"Hari Krishna"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Rajib"}],"event-place":"Tokyo","ISBN":"978-4-431-55242-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"199-210","publisher":"Springer Japan","publisher-place":"Tokyo","source":"Springer Link","title":"Snow Water Harvesting in the Cold Desert in Ladakh: An Introduction to Artificial Glacier","title-short":"Snow Water Harvesting in the Cold Desert in Ladakh","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-55242-0_11"},

These artificial glaciers meet local irrigation needs in the agricultural season by melting before natural glacial meltwater becomes available.

A combined methodological approach, including field observations, interviews, mapping and remote sensing analysis, was used to trace historical and recent changes in irrigation networks and land use patterns. Auf Grundlage von drei Fallstudien behandelt der Beitrag die Struktur und Dynamik von Bewässerungssystemen im oberen Hunza-Tal, einer Hochgebirgsregion im westlichen Karakorum, Pakistan. In den tief eingeschnittenen Tälern bilden die Schnee- und Gletscherschmelzwässer eine essentielle Voraussetzung für die landwirtschaftliche Nutzung. Die Fallstudien zeigen den Einfluss von Gletscherveränderungen auf die Bewässerungssysteme und Landnutzungsmuster und wie sich die lokalen Gemeinschaften wiederum auf diese Veränderungen einstellen. Diese Anpassungsstrategien werden hier als Teil eines sozio-hydrologischen Interaktionsmodells behandelt. Zur Erfassung und Analyse der historischen und rezenten Veränderungen des Bewässerungssystems und der Landnutzungsmuster dient ein Methodenverbund in dem sowohl Interviews und mündliche Überlieferungen, als auch detaillierte Feldaufnahmen und Fernerkundungsdaten einbezogen werden.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Parveen","given":"Sitara"},{"family":"Winiger","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Nüsser","given":"Marcus"}],"citation-key":"parveenIRRIGATIONUPPERHUNZA2015","container-title":"Erdkunde","ISSN":"0014-0015","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"69-85","publisher":"Erdkunde","source":"JSTOR","title":"IRRIGATION IN UPPER HUNZA: EVOLUTION OF SOCIO-HYDROLOGICAL INTERACTIONS IN THE KARAKORAM, NORTHERN PAKISTAN","title-short":"IRRIGATION IN UPPER HUNZA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24365265","volume":"69"},

  {"id":"sattarModelingLakeOutburst2021","abstract":"Climate change-driven retreat of glaciers is producing thousands of glacial lakes across mountain regions. These lakes generally grow, coalesce into larger lakes that may produce increased downstream hazards and risks due to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). This study assesses such hazards of Lower Barun Lake located near Mount Everest, Nepal. We model a series of scenarios, including two potential avalanches that enter the lake from the surrounding slope and eight potential GLOFs from the lake. To evaluate the susceptibility of the frontal moraine to overtopping, we characterize the initial avalanche-induced surge of water over the moraine caused by the kinetic energy of arriving masses and possible tsunami-like events. Further, we present physical hydrodynamic models that reveal the hazard from the potential overtopping and GLOF events along the Barun-Arun river valley. Special attention is given to analyze the flow hydraulics at six downstream settlements. To estimate potential impacts at each location, two extreme-magnitude, two high-magnitude, two moderate-magnitude, and two low-magnitude GLOFs were hydraulically evaluated for the present lake dimension and the modeled future growth of the lake. As with most hydrological processes, the magnitude and frequency of GLOFs from Lower Barun Lake have an inverse, albeit uncertain, relationship, but the potential impacts on people and infrastructure are extremely sensitive to the events’ magnitude. The flow dynamics results indicate that an overtopping flood without erosion of the damming moraine causes minimal impact in the valley. The extreme-magnitude and high-magnitude GLOF cases, where the moraine is incised, have a larger impact but differ greatly in magnitude at each of the downstream settlements. The moderate-magnitude and low-magnitude GLOFs, while the most frequent type, have limited volume and peak discharge, causing less impact downstream. Our calculations only portray the part of the hydrograph representing lake overfill due to a volume of ice or rock entering the lake, and the volume of the lake that could drain from a breach of the damming moraine down to specified depths over specified time periods.","author":[{"family":"Sattar","given":"Ashim"},{"family":"Haritashya","given":"Umesh K."},{"family":"Kargel","given":"Jeffrey S."},{"family":"Leonard","given":"Gregory J."},{"family":"Shugar","given":"Dan H."},{"family":"Chase","given":"Donald V."}],"citation-key":"sattarModelingLakeOutburst2021","container-title":"Journal of Hydrology","DOI":"10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2021.126208","ISSN":"0022-1694","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7]]},"page":"126208","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Modeling lake outburst and downstream hazard assessment of the Lower Barun Glacial Lake, Nepal Himalaya","type":"article-journal","volume":"598"},
  {"id":"sauterCOSIPYV1Opensource2020","abstract":"Glacier changes are a vivid example of how environmental systems react to a changing climate. Distributed surface mass balance models, which translate the meteorological conditions on glaciers into local melting rates, help to attribute and detect glacier mass and volume responses to changes in the climate drivers. A well-calibrated model is a suitable test bed for sensitivity, detection, and attribution analyses for many scientific applications and often serves as a tool for quantifying the inherent uncertainties. Here, we present the open-source COupled Snowpack and Ice surface energy and mass balance model in PYthon (COSIPY), which provides a flexible and user-friendly framework for modeling distributed snow and glacier mass changes. The model has a modular structure so that the exchange of routines or parameterizations of physical processes is possible with little effort for the user. The framework consists of a computational kernel, which forms the runtime environment and takes care of the initialization, the input–output routines, and the parallelization, as well as the grid and data structures. This structure offers maximum flexibility without having to worry about the internal numerical flow. The adaptive subsurface scheme allows an efficient and fast calculation of the otherwise computationally demanding fundamental equations. The surface energy balance scheme uses established standard parameterizations for radiation as well as for the energy exchange between atmosphere and surface. The schemes are coupled by solving both surface energy balance and subsurface fluxes iteratively such that consistent surface skin temperature is returned at the interface. COSIPY uses a one-dimensional approach limited to the vertical fluxes of energy and matter but neglects any lateral processes. Accordingly, the model can be easily set up in parallel computational environments for calculating both energy balance and climatic surface mass balance of glacier surfaces based on flexible horizontal grids and with varying temporal resolution. The model is made available on a freely accessible site and can be used for non-profit purposes. Scientists are encouraged to actively participate in the extension and improvement of the model code.","author":[{"family":"Sauter","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Arndt","given":"Anselm"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"sauterCOSIPYV1Opensource2020","container-title":"Geoscientific Model Development","DOI":"10.5194/GMD-13-5645-2020","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11]]},"page":"5645-5662","publisher":"Copernicus GmbH","title":"COSIPY v1.3 – an open-source coupled snowpack and ice surface energy and mass balance model","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"schutzeOCCASIONNewPlanning2010","abstract":"To sustain productive irrigated agriculture with limited water resources requires a high water use efficiency. This can be achieved by the precise scheduling of deficit irrigation systems taking into account the crops’ response to water stress at different stages of plant growth. Particularly in the light of climate change with rising population numbers and increasing water scarcity, an optimal solution for this task is of paramount importance. We solve the corresponding complex multidimensional and nonlinear optimization problem, i.e., finding the ideal schedule for maximum crop yield with a given water volume by a well tailored approach which offers straightforward application facilities. A global optimization technique allows, together with physically based modeling, for the risk assessment in yield reduction considering different sources of uncertainty (e.g., climate, soil conditions, and management). A new stochastic framework for decision support is developed which aims at optimal climate change adaption strategies in irrigation. It consists of: (1) a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate change; (2) a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply; and (3) mechanistic models for rigorously simulating water transport and crop growth. The result, namely, stochastic crop-water production functions, allows to assess the impact of climate variability on potential yield and thus provides a valuable tool for estimating minimum water demands for irrigation in water resources planning and management, assisting furthermore in generating maps of yield uncertainty for specific crops and specific agricultural areas. The tool is successfully applied at an experimental site in southern France. The impacts of predicted climate variability on maize are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Schütze","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Schmitz","given":"Gerd H."}],"citation-key":"schutzeOCCASIONNewPlanning2010","container-title":"Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering","DOI":"10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000266","ISSN":"0733-9437","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"836-846","publisher":"American Society of Civil Engineers","source":"ASCE","title":"OCCASION: New Planning Tool for Optimal Climate Change Adaption Strategies in Irrigation","title-short":"OCCASION","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29IR.1943-4774.0000266","volume":"136"},
  {"id":"shaheenClimateChangeImpact2013","abstract":"Climate change is a global phenomenon. The cold arid desert of North Western Himalaya is noticeably impacted by climate change. The increase in temperature and decline in precipitation over the period is more profound. The impact of climate change is in the form of rapid reduction in glaciers which has profound future implications for downstream water resources. The impacts of climate change in the region are superimposed on a variety of other environmental and social stresses. Community led adaptations in the harsh environments have significant impact on improving the livelihoods of the region. The creation of artificial glaciers to combat the receding of natural glaciers, thereby increasing water storage and its availability during summer; and production of vegetables in the peak winter through improved solar greenhouses which mitigates the CO2 emissions were identified as the major climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. The creation of artificial glaciers is a high altitude water conservation technique in the wake of climate change. With glacier retreat and shorter as well as warmer winters in the cold arid eco-region of Western Himalayas (Ladakh), the water crisis is compounding day by day. Construction of artificial glaciers is a means for harvesting glacial meltwater for the irrigation needs of farmers which otherwise goes waste. The technology has a wider scope for up-scaling and can be replicated in similar geo-climatic conditions. The impact of technology on the income of beneficiary is three to four times higher besides social and environmental benefits. Society needs to improve its adaptation strategies, and level structural inequalities that make adaptation by poor people more difficult. It is important to strengthen local knowledge, innovations, and practices within social and ecological systems as well as strengthening the functioning of institutions relevant for adaptation. Sound science together with credible, salient, legitimate knowledge is important to support the development and implementation of sound policies.

  {"id":"smolenaarsFutureUpstreamWater2022","abstract":"<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> The densely populated plains of the lower Indus Basin largely depend on water resources originating in the mountains of the transboundary upper Indus Basin. Recent studies have improved our understanding of this upstream–downstream linkage and the impact of climate change. However, water use in the mountainous part of the Indus and its hydropolitical implications have been largely ignored. This study quantifies the comparative impact of upper Indus water usage, through space and time, on downstream water availability under future climate change and socio-economic development. Future water consumption and relative pressure on water resources will vary greatly across seasons and between the various sub-basins of the upper Indus. During the dry season, the share of surface water required within the upper Indus is high and increasing, and in some transboundary sub-basins future water requirements exceed availability during the critical winter months. In turn this drives spatiotemporal hotspots to emerge in the lower Indus where seasonal water availability is reduced by over 25 % compared to natural conditions. This will play an important, but previously unaccounted for, compounding role in the steep decline of per capita seasonal water availability in the lower Indus in the future, alongside downstream population growth. Increasing consumption in the upper Indus may thus locally lead to water scarcity issues, and increasingly be a driver of downstream water stress during the dry season. Our quantified perspective on the evolving upstream–downstream linkages in the transboundary Indus Basin highlights that long-term shared water management here must account for rapid socio-economic change in the upper Indus and anticipate increasing competition between upstream and downstream riparian states.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Smolenaars","given":"Wouter J."},{"family":"Dhaubanjar","given":"Sanita"},{"family":"Jamil","given":"Muhammad K."},{"family":"Lutz","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Immerzeel","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Ludwig","given":"Fulco"},{"family":"Biemans","given":"Hester"}],"citation-key":"smolenaarsFutureUpstreamWater2022","container-title":"Hydrology and Earth System Sciences","DOI":"10.5194/hess-26-861-2022","ISSN":"1027-5606","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,17]]},"language":"English","page":"861-883","source":"hess.copernicus.org","title":"Future upstream water consumption and its impact on downstream water availability in the transboundary Indus Basin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/861/2022/","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"sohebMassbalanceObservationReconstruction2020","abstract":"We present the first-ever mass-balance (MB) observation (2014–19), reconstruction (between 1978 and 2019) and sensitivity of debris-free Stok glacier (33.98°N, 77.45°E), Ladakh Region, India. In-situ MB was negative throughout the study period except in 2018/19 when the glacier witnessed a balanced condition. For MB modelling, three periods were considered based on the available data. Period I (1978–87, 1988/89) witnessed a near balance condition (−0.03 ± 0.35 m w.e. a−1) with five positive MB years. Whereas Period II (1998–2002, 2003–09) and III (2011–19) experienced high (−0.9 ± 0.35 m w.e. a−1) and moderate (−0.46 ± 0.35 m w.e. a−1) negative MBs, respectively. Glacier area for these periods was derived from the Corona, Landsat and PlanetScope imageries using a semi-automatic approach. The in-situ and modelled MBs were in good agreement with RMSE of 0.23 m w.e. a−1, R2 = 0.92, P < 0.05. The average mass loss was moderate (−0.47 ± 0.35 m w.e. a−1) over 28 hydrological years between 1978 and 2019. Sensitivity analysis showed that the glacier was more sensitive to summer temperature (−0.32 m w.e. a−1 °C−1) and winter precipitation (0.12 m w.e. a−1 for ± 10%). It was estimated that ~27% increase in precipitation is required on Stok glacier to compensate for the mass loss due to 1°C rise in temperature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Soheb","given":"Mohd"},{"family":"Ramanathan","given":"Alagappan"},{"family":"Angchuk","given":"Thupstan"},{"family":"Mandal","given":"Arindan"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Naveen"},{"family":"Lotus","given":"Sonam"}],"citation-key":"sohebMassbalanceObservationReconstruction2020","container-title":"Journal of Glaciology","DOI":"10.1017/jog.2020.34","ISSN":"0022-1430, 1727-5652","issue":"258","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,8]]},"language":"en","page":"627-642","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Mass-balance observation, reconstruction and sensitivity of Stok glacier, Ladakh region, India, between 1978 and 2019","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/massbalance-observation-reconstruction-and-sensitivity-of-stok-glacier-ladakh-region-india-between-1978-and-2019/2A377BFA5EAD2A05E6A6A041305BDCCD","volume":"66"},
  {"id":"soulisInvestigatingEffectsSoil2015","abstract":"Recent advances in electromagnetic sensor technologies have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing devices. However, many of the available guidelines for sensor placement were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments. Sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting irrigation efficiency. This study investigates how soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems under various conditions. For this purpose several numerical experiments were carried out using a mathematical model, incorporating a system-dependent boundary condition in order to simulate soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems. The results of this study provided clear evidence that soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation efficiency in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. In specific cases the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was as high as 16%; however, when nearby sensor positions were examined, the observed differences were generally low. The effect of sensors accuracy was even clearer. For the lower sensor's error level studied (±0.01cm3cm−3) the effect on irrigation efficiency ranged between 2.5% and 6.4%, while for the higher error level (±0.03cm3cm−3) the effect ranged between 10.2% and 18.7%. These results highlight the importance of a detailed study taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation, and scheduling systems as well as soil moisture sensors in order to provide a sound basis for improved irrigation scheduling. The need for soil specific calibration of the sensors used in such systems is highlighted as well. Lastly, a significant outcome of this study is the ability of computer models to serve as efficient tools for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning and accuracy, or other automated scheduling system characteristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Soulis","given":"Konstantinos X."},{"family":"Elmaloglou","given":"Stamatios"},{"family":"Dercas","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"soulisInvestigatingEffectsSoil2015","container-title":"Agricultural Water Management","container-title-short":"Agricultural Water Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.agwat.2014.10.015","ISSN":"0378-3774","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,31]]},"language":"en","page":"258-268","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Investigating the effects of soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy on soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377414003357","volume":"148"},
  {"id":"steinerImportanceTurbulentFluxes2018","abstract":"Surface energy balance models are common tools to estimate melt rates of debris-covered glaciers. In the Himalayas, radiative fluxes are occasionally measured, but very limited observations of turbulent fluxes on debris-covered tongues exist to date. We present measurements collected between 26 September and 12 October 2016 from an eddy correlation system installed on the debris-covered Lirung Glacier in Nepal during the transition between monsoon and post-monsoon. Our observations suggest that surface energy losses through turbulent fluxes reduce the positive net radiative fluxes during daylight hours between 10 and 100%, and even lead to a net negative surface energy balance after noon. During clear days, turbulent flux losses increase to over 250 W m−2 mainly due to high sensible heat fluxes. During overcast days the latent heat flux dominates the turbulent losses and together they reach just above 100 W m−2. Subsequently, we validate the performance of three bulk approaches in reproducing the observations from the eddy correlation system. Large differences exist between the approaches, and accurate estimates of surface temperature, wind speed, and surface roughness are necessary for their performance to be reasonable. Moreover, the tested bulk approaches generally overestimate turbulent latent heat fluxes by a factor 3 on clear days, because the debris-covered surface dries out rapidly, while the bulk equations assume surface saturation. Improvements to bulk surface energy models should therefore include the drying process of the surface. A sensitivity analysis suggests that, in order to be useful in distributed melt models, an accurate extrapolation of wind speed, surface temperature and surface roughness in space is a prerequisite. By applying the best performing bulk model over a complete melt period, we show that turbulent fluxes reduce the available energy for melt at the debris surface by 17% even at very low wind speeds. Overall, we conclude that turbulent fluxes play an essential role in the surface energy balance of debris-covered glaciers and that it is essential to include them in melt models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Steiner","given":"Jakob F."},{"family":"Litt","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Stigter","given":"Emmy E."},{"family":"Shea","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Bierkens","given":"Marc F.

  {"id":"weaverClimateWitnessOral2022","abstract":"On August 5, 2010, a violent cloudburst dumped fourteen inches of rain on Ladakh, a mountain desert region in the far north of India accustomed to getting just three inches of rain in a year. Five years later, flooding recurred on a wider scale, destroying buildings, roads, fields, and orchards all over Ladakh and provoking a wide-ranging discussion among locals about the causes of climate catastrophe. In this essay, we attend to those local voices and allow the people of Ladakh to speak for themselves about the causes and consequences of climate change as well as the best forms of climate change adaptation in the trans-Himalayan region. We offer a two-year progress report on our ongoing oral history fieldwork in this unique and ecologically sensitive high desert region. At the same time, we offer some reflections on the discipline of oral history itself and the promise it offers in conjunction with community engagement to the study of climate change. The surprising fact remains that despite much recent and inspiring work at the compelling intersection of oral and environmental history, few oral historians have taken on directly the subject of climate change, and those who have tend to dwell on the specific experience of the American West. Here we join those few oral and environmental historians who are approaching climate change by way of global community engagement. Only by way of such engagement, we argue—only by following the best practices of what has come to be known as community-based participatory research, can oral history fulfill its public mission as we understand it and contribute decisively to the humanistic study of the Anthropocene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Weaver","given":"Stewart"},{"family":"Bakhmetyeva","given":"Tatyana"},{"family":"Rinn","given":"Daniel Wayne"}],"citation-key":"weaverClimateWitnessOral2022","container-title":"The Oral History Review","DOI":"10.1080/00940798.2022.2038016","ISSN":"0094-0798","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,2]]},"page":"1-21","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Climate Witness: Oral Environmental History and Community-Based Research—A Case Study from Trans-Himalayan India","title-short":"Climate Witness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00940798.2022.2038016","volume":"0"},

The Green and Ampt model employs newly developed techniques for parameterizing the Green and Ampt equation based on readily available soil and vegetation information. Annual, monthly and daily predicted runoff were compared to observed on six uncalibrated rangeland catchments located in Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, Nebraska and Idaho. Model parameterization was based strictly on individual catchment characteristics. No model calibration was performed. Results indicate that the Green and Ampt model is a potentially useful tool for predicting runoff.

  {"id":"xenariosAralSeaBasin2019","abstract":"This book offers the first multidisciplinary overview of water resources issues and management in the Aral Sea Basin, covering both the Amu Darya and Syr Darya River Basins. The two main rivers of Amu Darya and Syr Darya and their tributaries comprise the Aral Sea Basin area and are the lifeline for about 70 million inhabitants in Central Asia. Written by regional and international experts, this book critically examines the current state, trends and future of water resources management and development in this major part of the Central Asia region. It brings together insights on the history of water management in the region, surface and groundwater assessment, issues of transboundary water management and environmental degradation and restoration, and an overview of the importance of water for the key economic sectors and overall socio-economic development of Central Asian countries, as well as of hydro politics in the region. The book also focusses on the future of water sector development in the Basin, including a review of local and international actors, as well as an analysis of the current status and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals by Basin countries. The book will be essential reading for those interested in sea basin management, environmental policy in Central Asia and water resource management more widely. It will also act as a reference source for decision-makers in state agencies, as well as a background source of information for NGOs.

  {"id":"zempGlobalGlacierMass2019","abstract":"Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets cover an area of approximately 706,000 square kilometres globally1, with an estimated total volume of 170,000 cubic kilometres, or 0.4 metres of potential sea-level-rise equivalent2. Retreating and thinning glaciers are icons of climate change3 and affect regional runoff4 as well as global sea level5,6. In past reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, estimates of changes in glacier mass were based on the multiplication of averaged or interpolated results from available observations of a few hundred glaciers by defined regional glacier areas7–10. For data-scarce regions, these results had to be complemented with estimates based on satellite altimetry and gravimetry11. These past approaches were challenged by the small number and heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of in situ measurement series and their often unknown ability to represent their respective mountain ranges, as well as by the spatial limitations of satellite altimetry (for which only point data are available) and gravimetry (with its coarse resolution). Here we use an extrapolation of glaciological and geodetic observations to show that glaciers contributed 27 ± 22 millimetres to global mean sea-level rise from 1961 to 2016. Regional specific-mass-change rates for 2006–2016 range from −0.1 metres to −1.2 metres of water equivalent per year, resulting in a global sea-level contribution of 335 ± 144 gigatonnes, or 0.92 ± 0.39 millimetres, per year. Although statistical uncertainty ranges overlap, our conclusions suggest that glacier mass loss may be larger than previously reported11. The present glacier mass loss is equivalent to the sea-level contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet12, clearly exceeds the loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet13, and accounts for 25 to 30 per cent of the total observed sea-level rise14. Present mass-loss rates indicate that glaciers could almost disappear in some mountain ranges in this century, while heavily glacierized regions will continue to contribute to sea-level rise beyond 2100.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Zemp","given":"M."},{"family":"Huss","given":"M."},{"family":"Thibert","given":"E."},{"family":"Eckert","given":"N."},{"family":"McNabb","given":"R."},{"family":"Huber","given":"J."},{"family":"Barandun","given":"M."},{"family":"Machguth","given":"H."},{"family":"Nussbaumer","given":"S.
