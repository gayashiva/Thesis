  {"id":"abrishambafAgriculturalIrrigationScheduling2020","abstract":"Center pivot systems are widely used to overcome the irrigation needs of agricultural fields. In this paper, an autonomous approach is proposed in order to improve the low efficiency of irrigation by developing a system based on the water requirement of the plantations, through field data. The data are local temperature, local wind, soil moisture, precipitation forecast, and soil evapotranspiration calculation. This information enables the system to calculate the real evapotranspiration for not being necessary to restrict to lysimetric measures. By this way, the system schedules the irrigation for the lower cost periods, considering the produced energy by the local resources, and the price of energy purchased from the utility grid. Also, it is considered that the irrigation must be carried out within the time interval in which the plantations do not reach the wilding point, so it will be carried out at the periods with the lowest cost. This will optimize the overall operational costs of the irrigation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Abrishambaf","given":"Omid"},{"family":"Faria","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Gomes","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Vale","given":"Zita"}],"citation-key":"abrishambafAgriculturalIrrigationScheduling2020","collection-title":"The 6th International Conference on Energy and Environment Research - Energy and environment: challenges towards circular economy","container-title":"Energy Reports","container-title-short":"Energy Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.egyr.2019.08.031","ISSN":"2352-4847","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"133-139","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Agricultural irrigation scheduling for a crop management system considering water and energy use optimization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352484719306250","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"banerjeeVolumeareaScalingDebriscovered2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            A volume-area scaling relation is commonly used to estimate glacier volume or its future changes on a global scale. The presence of an insulating supraglacial debris cover alters the mass-balance profile of a glacier, potentially modifying the scaling relation. Here, the nature of scaling relations for extensively debris-covered glaciers is investigated. Theoretical arguments suggest that the volume-area scaling exponent for these glaciers is ~7% smaller than that for clean glaciers. This is consistent with the results from flowline-model simulations of idealised glaciers, and the available data from the Himalaya. The best-fit scale factor for debris-covered Himalayan glaciers is ~60% larger compared to that for the clean ones, implying a significantly larger stored ice volume in a debris-covered glacier compared to a clean one having the same area. These results may help improve scaling-based estimates of glacier volume and future glacier changes in regions where debris-covered glaciers are abundant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Banerjee","given":"Argha"}],"citation-key":"banerjeeVolumeareaScalingDebriscovered2020","container-title":"Journal of Glaciology","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"bolibarNonlinearSensitivityGlacier2022","abstract":"Glaciers and ice caps are experiencing strong mass losses worldwide, challenging water availability, hydropower generation, and ecosystems. Here, we perform the first-ever glacier evolution projections based on deep learning by modelling the 21st century glacier evolution in the French Alps. By the end of the century, we predict a glacier volume loss between 75 and 88%. Deep learning captures a nonlinear response of glaciers to air temperature and precipitation, improving the representation of extreme mass balance rates compared to linear statistical and temperature-index models. Our results confirm an over-sensitivity of temperature-index models, often used by large-scale studies, to future warming. We argue that such models can be suitable for steep mountain glaciers. However, glacier projections under low-emission scenarios and the behaviour of flatter glaciers and ice caps are likely to be biased by mass balance models with linear sensitivities, introducing long-term biases in sea-level rise and water resources projections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bolibar","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Rabatel","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Gouttevin","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Zekollari","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Galiez","given":"Clovis"}],"citation-key":"bolibarNonlinearSensitivityGlacier2022","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-022-28033-0","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cryospheric science;Geophysics\nSubject_term_id: cryospheric-science;geophysics","number":"1","page":"409","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Nonlinear sensitivity of glacier mass balance to future climate change unveiled by deep learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28033-0","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"fortesGISAREGGISBased2005","abstract":"To support improved irrigation scheduling in the Syr Darya basin, Uzbekistan, the ISAREG model was selected due to previous applications in similar climates. It is a conceptual non-distributed water balance model for simulating crop irrigation schedules at field level and to compute irrigation requirements under optimal and/or water stressed conditions. To provide for the use of the model at the project scale, a new version of the model, integrated with a Geographical Information System (GIS), was developed. This GIS based application is aimed at supporting the implementation of improved farm irrigation management and, in a later phase, to also help project management. The integration concerns the creation of spatial and weather GIS databases usable by ISAREG, the models operation for different water management scenarios, and the production of crop irrigation maps and time dependent irrigation depths at selected aggregation modes, including the farm scale. The resulting information on alternative irrigation schedules is, therefore, spatially distributed and shall be used both to support irrigation scheduling advising and to help in the identification of practices that may lead to water saving and provide for salinity control. The paper includes brief descriptions of the models, the databases and the integration of the models, as well as main features of the GISAREG application. Results relative to the comparative analysis of irrigation scheduling scenarios show the capabilities of the model to support the selection of water saving alternatives. The appropriateness of implementing 15–20-day time intervals between irrigations is shown. In addition, results relative to compare net irrigation requirements for wet and dry years show the usefulness of the model in handling time series of weather data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Fortes","given":"P.

The accuracy for the clear sky beam, global and diffuse irradiance components compared to the original model are, respectively, 1%, 2% and 5% with no bias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Ineichen","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"ineichenBroadbandSimplifiedVersion2008","container-title":"Solar Energy","container-title-short":"Solar Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.solener.2008.02.009","ISSN":"0038-092X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"758-762","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A broadband simplified version of the Solis clear sky model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X08000406","volume":"82"},
  {"id":"ineichenValidationModelsThat2016","abstract":"The optimal utilization of solar energy requires a thorough characterization of the solar resource. The most accurate way is to measure that resource in situ. However accurate measurements are not a common commodity, especially over longer time spans. To circumvent the lack of ground based measurements, models can be applied to estimate solar irradiance components. A fundamental component is clear sky irradiance. In particular, clear sky irradiance is used as the normalization function in models that convert meteorological satellite images into irradiance, or in models that decompose global irradiance into diffuse/direct fraction. It is therefore important to evaluate and validate clear sky irradiance models. This paper presents the results of a validation of hourly clear sky models spanning up to eight years. The validation relies on high quality measurements at 22 locations in Europe and around the Mediterranean region. Seven models are evaluated. They were selected on the basis of their published performance, their simplicity of use, and/or their computational speed; two different sources of the aerosol load are used as input to the models. The three best models show a low bias and a standard deviation ranging from ±3% to ±5%. The standard deviation of the bias across the 22 locations is of the same order of magnitude. The observed bias patterns can be largely traced to inaccuracies inherent to the sources aerosol optical depth. No particular seasonal effects are noted. A consistent limitation across all selected models, even if their direct irradiance performance can be judged satisfactory based on the standard deviation metric, is that they tend to fall short of observations for a given clear sky global clearness index value.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Ineichen","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"ineichenValidationModelsThat2016","container-title":"Solar Energy","container-title-short":"Solar Energy","DOI":"10.1016/j.solener.2016.03.017","ISSN":"0038-092X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"332-344","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Validation of models that estimate the clear sky global and beam solar irradiance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X16002048","volume":"132"},

  {"id":"krinitskiyGeneralizationAbilityDataDriven2021","abstract":"Total Cloud Cover (TCC) retrieval from ground-based optical imagery is a problem that has been tackled by several generations of researchers. The number of human-designed algorithms for the estimation of TCC grows every year. However, there has been no considerable progress in terms of quality, mostly due to the lack of systematic approach to the design of the algorithms, to the assessment of their generalization ability, and to the assessment of the TCC retrieval quality. In this study, we discuss the optimization nature of data-driven schemes for TCC retrieval. In order to compare the algorithms, we propose a framework for the assessment of the algorithms&rsquo; characteristics. We present several new algorithms that are based on deep learning techniques: A model for outliers filtering, and a few models for TCC retrieval from all-sky imagery. For training and assessment of data-driven algorithms of this study, we present the Dataset of All-Sky Imagery over the Ocean (DASIO) containing over one million all-sky optical images of the visible sky dome taken in various regions of the world ocean. The research campaigns that contributed to the DASIO collection took place in the Atlantic ocean, the Indian ocean, the Red and Mediterranean seas, and the Arctic ocean. Optical imagery collected during these missions are accompanied by standard meteorological observations of cloudiness characteristics made by experienced observers. We assess the generalization ability of the presented models in several scenarios that differ in terms of the regions selected for the train and test subsets. As a result, we demonstrate that our models based on convolutional neural networks deliver a superior quality compared to all previously published approaches. As a key result, we demonstrate a considerable drop in the ability to generalize the training data in the case of a strong covariate shift between the training and test subsets of imagery which may occur in the case of region-aware subsampling.","author":[{"family":"Krinitskiy","given":"Mikhail"},{"family":"Aleksandrova","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Verezemskaya","given":"Polina"},{"family":"Gulev","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Sinitsyn","given":"Alexey"},{"family":"Kovaleva","given":"Nadezhda"},{"family":"Gavrikov","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"krinitskiyGeneralizationAbilityDataDriven2021","container-title":"Remote Sensing 2021, Vol. 13, Page 326","DOI":"10.3390/RS13020326","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"page":"326","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","title":"On the Generalization Ability of Data-Driven Models in the Problem of Total Cloud Cover Retrieval","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/2/326/htm https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/2/326","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"luoEstimationTotalCloud2010","abstract":"The DYRESM-CAEDYM model is a valuable tool for simulating water temperature for biochemical studies in aquatic ecosystem. The model requires inputs of surface short-wave radiation and long-wave radiation or total cloud cover fraction (TC). Long-wave radiation is often not measured directly so a method to determine TC from commonly measured short-wave solar irradiance (E0) and theoretical short-wave solar irradiance under a clear sky (Ec) has broad application. A more than 17-year (15 November 1991 to 20 February 2009) hourly solar irradiance data set was used to estimate the peak solar irradiance for each ordinal date over one year, which was assumed to be representative of solar irradiance in the absence of cloud. Comparison between these daily observed values and the modelled clear-sky solar radiation over one year was in close agreement (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.995 and root mean squared error, RMSE = 12.54 W m-2). The downloaded hourly cloudiness measurements from 15 November 1991 to 20 February 2009 was used to calculate the daily values for this period and then the calculated daily values over the 17 years were used to calculate the average values for each ordinal date over one year. A regression equation between (1 - E0/Ec) and TC produced a correlation coefficient value of 0.99 (p > 0.01, n = 71). The validation of this cloud cover estimation model was conducted with observed short-wave solar radiation and TC at two sites. Values of TC derived from the model at the Lake Rotorua site gave a reasonable prediction of the observed values (RMSE = 0.10, r = 0.86, p > 0.01, n = 61). The model was also tested at Queenstown (South Island of New Zealand) and it provided satisfactory results compared to the measurements (RMSE = 0.16, r = 0.67, p > 0.01, n = 61). Therefore the model's good performance and broad applicability will contribute to the DYRESM-CAEDYM accuracy of water temperature simulation when long-wave radiation is not available. © 2010.","author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Liancong"},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"David"},{"family":"Han","given":"Boping"}],"citation-key":"luoEstimationTotalCloud2010","container-title":"Solar Energy","DOI":"10.1016/J.SOLENER.2010.01.012","ISSN":"0038-092X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,3]]},"page":"501-506","publisher":"Pergamon","title":"Estimation of total cloud cover from solar radiation observations at Lake Rotorua, New Zealand","type":"article-journal","volume":"84"},

  {"id":"mandal11yearRecordWintertime2022","abstract":"Abstract. Analysis of surface energy balance (SEB) at the glacier surface is the most comprehensive way to explain the atmosphere-glacier interactions but that requires extensive data. In this study, we analyse an 11-year (2009–2020) record of the meteorological dataset from an automatic weather station installed at 4863 m a.s.l., on a lateral moraine of the Chhota Shigri Glacier in the western Himalaya. The study was carried out over the winter months (December to April) to understand SEB drivers and snow sublimation. Further, we examine the role of cloud cover on SEB and turbulent heat fluxes. The turbulent heat fluxes were calculated using the bulk-aerodynamic method, including stability corrections. The net short-wave radiation was the primary energy source. However, the turbulent heat fluxes dissipated a significant amount of energy. The cloud cover plays an important role in limiting the incoming short-wave radiation by 70 %. It also restricts the turbulent heat fluxes by around 50 %, consequently less snow sublimation. During the winter period, turbulent latent heat flux contributed the largest (63 %) in the total SEB, followed by net all-wave radiation (29 %) and sensible heat flux (8 %). Sublimation rates were three times higher in clear-sky conditions than overcast, indicating a strong control of cloud cover in turbulent latent heat flux. Dry air, along with the high snow surface temperature and wind speed, favours sublimation. We also observed that strong and cold winds, possibly through mid-latitude western disturbances, impede sublimation by bringing high moisture content in the region and cooling the snow surface. The estimated snow sublimation fraction was 16–42 % of the total winter snowfall at the study site. This indicates snow sublimation is an essential parameter to be considered in the glaciohydrological modelling at the high mountain Himalayan catchments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Mandal","given":"Arindan"},{"family":"Angchuk","given":"Thupstan"},{"family":"Azam","given":"Mohd Farooq"},{"family":"Ramanathan","given":"Alagappan"},{"family":"Wagnon","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Soheb","given":"Mohd"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Chetan"}],"citation-key":"mandal11yearRecordWintertime2022","DOI":"10.5194/tc-2021-386","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]]},"publisher":"Snow/Energy Balance Obs/Modelling","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"11-year record of wintertime snow surface energy balance and sublimation at 4863 m a.s.l. on Chhota Shigri Glacier moraine (western Himalaya, India)","type":"report","URL":"https://tc.copernicus.org/preprints/tc-2021-386/"},
  {"id":"matthewsGoingExtremesInstalling2020","abstract":"As the highest mountain on Earth, Mount Everest is an iconic peak that offers an unrivalled natural platform for measuring ongoing climate change across the full elevation range of Asia’s water towers. However, Everest’s extreme environment challenges data collection, particularly on the mountain’s upper slopes, where glaciers accumulate mass and mountaineers are most exposed. Weather stations have operated on Everest before, including the world’s previous highest, but coverage has been sparse in space and time. Here we describe the installation of a network of five automatic weather stations (AWSs), including the two highest stations on Earth (8,430 m.a.s.l and 7,945 m.a.s.l) which greatly improves monitoring of this iconic mountain. We highlight sample applications of the new data, including an initial assessment of surface energy fluxes at Camp II (6,464 m.a.s.l) and the South Col (7,945 m.a.s.l), which suggest melt occurs at both sites, despite persistently below-freezing air temperatures. This analysis indicates that melt may even be possible at the 8,850 m.a.s.l summit, and prompts a reevaluation of empirical temperature index models used to simulate glacier melt in the Himalaya that focus only on air temperature. We also provide the first evaluation of numerical weather forecasts at almost 8,000 m.a.s.l and use of model output statistics to reduce forecast error, showcasing an important opportunity to improve climber safety on Everest. Looking forward, we emphasize the considerable potential of these freely available data for understanding weather and climate in the Himalaya and beyond, including tracking the behavior of upper-atmosphere winds, which the AWS network is uniquely positioned to monitor.","author":[{"family":"Matthews","given":"T."},{"family":"Perry","given":"L.

  {"id":"sattarModelingLakeOutburst2021","abstract":"Climate change-driven retreat of glaciers is producing thousands of glacial lakes across mountain regions. These lakes generally grow, coalesce into larger lakes that may produce increased downstream hazards and risks due to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). This study assesses such hazards of Lower Barun Lake located near Mount Everest, Nepal. We model a series of scenarios, including two potential avalanches that enter the lake from the surrounding slope and eight potential GLOFs from the lake. To evaluate the susceptibility of the frontal moraine to overtopping, we characterize the initial avalanche-induced surge of water over the moraine caused by the kinetic energy of arriving masses and possible tsunami-like events. Further, we present physical hydrodynamic models that reveal the hazard from the potential overtopping and GLOF events along the Barun-Arun river valley. Special attention is given to analyze the flow hydraulics at six downstream settlements. To estimate potential impacts at each location, two extreme-magnitude, two high-magnitude, two moderate-magnitude, and two low-magnitude GLOFs were hydraulically evaluated for the present lake dimension and the modeled future growth of the lake. As with most hydrological processes, the magnitude and frequency of GLOFs from Lower Barun Lake have an inverse, albeit uncertain, relationship, but the potential impacts on people and infrastructure are extremely sensitive to the events’ magnitude. The flow dynamics results indicate that an overtopping flood without erosion of the damming moraine causes minimal impact in the valley. The extreme-magnitude and high-magnitude GLOF cases, where the moraine is incised, have a larger impact but differ greatly in magnitude at each of the downstream settlements. The moderate-magnitude and low-magnitude GLOFs, while the most frequent type, have limited volume and peak discharge, causing less impact downstream. Our calculations only portray the part of the hydrograph representing lake overfill due to a volume of ice or rock entering the lake, and the volume of the lake that could drain from a breach of the damming moraine down to specified depths over specified time periods.","author":[{"family":"Sattar","given":"Ashim"},{"family":"Haritashya","given":"Umesh K."},{"family":"Kargel","given":"Jeffrey S."},{"family":"Leonard","given":"Gregory J."},{"family":"Shugar","given":"Dan H."},{"family":"Chase","given":"Donald V."}],"citation-key":"sattarModelingLakeOutburst2021","container-title":"Journal of Hydrology","DOI":"10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2021.126208","ISSN":"0022-1694","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7]]},"page":"126208","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Modeling lake outburst and downstream hazard assessment of the Lower Barun Glacial Lake, Nepal Himalaya","type":"article-journal","volume":"598"},
  {"id":"sauterCOSIPYV1Opensource2020","abstract":"Glacier changes are a vivid example of how environmental systems react to a changing climate. Distributed surface mass balance models, which translate the meteorological conditions on glaciers into local melting rates, help to attribute and detect glacier mass and volume responses to changes in the climate drivers. A well-calibrated model is a suitable test bed for sensitivity, detection, and attribution analyses for many scientific applications and often serves as a tool for quantifying the inherent uncertainties. Here, we present the open-source COupled Snowpack and Ice surface energy and mass balance model in PYthon (COSIPY), which provides a flexible and user-friendly framework for modeling distributed snow and glacier mass changes. The model has a modular structure so that the exchange of routines or parameterizations of physical processes is possible with little effort for the user. The framework consists of a computational kernel, which forms the runtime environment and takes care of the initialization, the input–output routines, and the parallelization, as well as the grid and data structures. This structure offers maximum flexibility without having to worry about the internal numerical flow. The adaptive subsurface scheme allows an efficient and fast calculation of the otherwise computationally demanding fundamental equations. The surface energy balance scheme uses established standard parameterizations for radiation as well as for the energy exchange between atmosphere and surface. The schemes are coupled by solving both surface energy balance and subsurface fluxes iteratively such that consistent surface skin temperature is returned at the interface. COSIPY uses a one-dimensional approach limited to the vertical fluxes of energy and matter but neglects any lateral processes. Accordingly, the model can be easily set up in parallel computational environments for calculating both energy balance and climatic surface mass balance of glacier surfaces based on flexible horizontal grids and with varying temporal resolution. The model is made available on a freely accessible site and can be used for non-profit purposes. Scientists are encouraged to actively participate in the extension and improvement of the model code.","author":[{"family":"Sauter","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Arndt","given":"Anselm"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Christoph"}],"citation-key":"sauterCOSIPYV1Opensource2020","container-title":"Geoscientific Model Development","DOI":"10.5194/GMD-13-5645-2020","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11]]},"page":"5645-5662","publisher":"Copernicus GmbH","title":"COSIPY v1.3 – an open-source coupled snowpack and ice surface energy and mass balance model","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"schutzeOCCASIONNewPlanning2010","abstract":"To sustain productive irrigated agriculture with limited water resources requires a high water use efficiency. This can be achieved by the precise scheduling of deficit irrigation systems taking into account the crops’ response to water stress at different stages of plant growth. Particularly in the light of climate change with rising population numbers and increasing water scarcity, an optimal solution for this task is of paramount importance. We solve the corresponding complex multidimensional and nonlinear optimization problem, i.e., finding the ideal schedule for maximum crop yield with a given water volume by a well tailored approach which offers straightforward application facilities. A global optimization technique allows, together with physically based modeling, for the risk assessment in yield reduction considering different sources of uncertainty (e.g., climate, soil conditions, and management). A new stochastic framework for decision support is developed which aims at optimal climate change adaption strategies in irrigation. It consists of: (1) a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate change; (2) a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply; and (3) mechanistic models for rigorously simulating water transport and crop growth. The result, namely, stochastic crop-water production functions, allows to assess the impact of climate variability on potential yield and thus provides a valuable tool for estimating minimum water demands for irrigation in water resources planning and management, assisting furthermore in generating maps of yield uncertainty for specific crops and specific agricultural areas. The tool is successfully applied at an experimental site in southern France. The impacts of predicted climate variability on maize are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Schütze","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Schmitz","given":"Gerd H."}],"citation-key":"schutzeOCCASIONNewPlanning2010","container-title":"Journal of Irrigation and Drainage Engineering","DOI":"10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000266","ISSN":"0733-9437","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,12,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"836-846","publisher":"American Society of Civil Engineers","source":"ASCE","title":"OCCASION: New Planning Tool for Optimal Climate Change Adaption Strategies in Irrigation","title-short":"OCCASION","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29IR.1943-4774.0000266","volume":"136"},

  {"id":"soulisInvestigatingEffectsSoil2015","abstract":"Recent advances in electromagnetic sensor technologies have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing devices. However, many of the available guidelines for sensor placement were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments. Sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting irrigation efficiency. This study investigates how soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems under various conditions. For this purpose several numerical experiments were carried out using a mathematical model, incorporating a system-dependent boundary condition in order to simulate soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems. The results of this study provided clear evidence that soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation efficiency in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. In specific cases the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was as high as 16%; however, when nearby sensor positions were examined, the observed differences were generally low. The effect of sensors accuracy was even clearer. For the lower sensor's error level studied (±0.01cm3cm−3) the effect on irrigation efficiency ranged between 2.5% and 6.4%, while for the higher error level (±0.03cm3cm−3) the effect ranged between 10.2% and 18.7%. These results highlight the importance of a detailed study taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation, and scheduling systems as well as soil moisture sensors in order to provide a sound basis for improved irrigation scheduling. The need for soil specific calibration of the sensors used in such systems is highlighted as well. Lastly, a significant outcome of this study is the ability of computer models to serve as efficient tools for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning and accuracy, or other automated scheduling system characteristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Soulis","given":"Konstantinos X."},{"family":"Elmaloglou","given":"Stamatios"},{"family":"Dercas","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"soulisInvestigatingEffectsSoil2015","container-title":"Agricultural Water Management","container-title-short":"Agricultural Water Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.agwat.2014.10.015","ISSN":"0378-3774","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,31]]},"language":"en","page":"258-268","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Investigating the effects of soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy on soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377414003357","volume":"148"},
  {"id":"steinerImportanceTurbulentFluxes2018","abstract":"Surface energy balance models are common tools to estimate melt rates of debris-covered glaciers. In the Himalayas, radiative fluxes are occasionally measured, but very limited observations of turbulent fluxes on debris-covered tongues exist to date. We present measurements collected between 26 September and 12 October 2016 from an eddy correlation system installed on the debris-covered Lirung Glacier in Nepal during the transition between monsoon and post-monsoon. Our observations suggest that surface energy losses through turbulent fluxes reduce the positive net radiative fluxes during daylight hours between 10 and 100%, and even lead to a net negative surface energy balance after noon. During clear days, turbulent flux losses increase to over 250 W m−2 mainly due to high sensible heat fluxes. During overcast days the latent heat flux dominates the turbulent losses and together they reach just above 100 W m−2. Subsequently, we validate the performance of three bulk approaches in reproducing the observations from the eddy correlation system. Large differences exist between the approaches, and accurate estimates of surface temperature, wind speed, and surface roughness are necessary for their performance to be reasonable. Moreover, the tested bulk approaches generally overestimate turbulent latent heat fluxes by a factor 3 on clear days, because the debris-covered surface dries out rapidly, while the bulk equations assume surface saturation. Improvements to bulk surface energy models should therefore include the drying process of the surface. A sensitivity analysis suggests that, in order to be useful in distributed melt models, an accurate extrapolation of wind speed, surface temperature and surface roughness in space is a prerequisite. By applying the best performing bulk model over a complete melt period, we show that turbulent fluxes reduce the available energy for melt at the debris surface by 17% even at very low wind speeds. Overall, we conclude that turbulent fluxes play an essential role in the surface energy balance of debris-covered glaciers and that it is essential to include them in melt models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Steiner","given":"Jakob F."},{"family":"Litt","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Stigter","given":"Emmy E."},{"family":"Shea","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Bierkens","given":"Marc F.
