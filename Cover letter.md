We are happy to present the manuscript titled "Fountain scheduling strategies for improving water-use efficiency of artificial ice reservoirs (Ice stupas)" to the Cold regions science and technology journal. This study provides software and hardware tools to reduce the water losses and maintenance effort of ice stupas. Through a case study of ice stupas in Guttannen, Switzerland, we showcase an automated construction strategy that can both reduce water losses and maintenance effort significantly. We believe the results provided could guide water management strategies, especially in dry and cold mountain regions in Central Asia or the Andes impacted by climate change induced water stress.
