# [[Irrigation]]
The effect of cryosphere change on local meltwater-dependent [[irrigation]] practices has received much less attention [[@kreutzmannWaterTowersMankind1998]], even though dependence on glacier meltwater and vulnerability to cryosphere dynamics are of serious concern in all mountain areas. 

Irrigated agriculture in arid mountain regions are completely dependent on timely availability of meltwater from glaciers, snow and permafrost.  

Cryosphere-fed irrigation networks in arid mountain regions are completely dependent on timely availability of meltwater from glaciers, snow and permafrost.  The effect of glacier decline has made such regions prone to water scarcity in spring. This seasonal water scarcity makes it essential to provide supplementary [[irrigation]] in order to take advantage of the complete growing season and to sustain irrigation area.

To cope with seasonal scarcity at critical times for [[irrigation]], some communities have developed sophisticated irrigation techniques and infrastructure to cope with recurrent water scarcity [[@ashrafInfluentialAspectsGlacial2018]].
