# [[irrigation]]
Cryosphere-fed irrigation networks in arid mountain regions are completely dependent on timely availability of meltwater from glaciers, snow and permafrost.  The effect of glacier decline has made such regions prone to water scarcity in spring  . This seasonal water scarcity makes it essential to provide supplementary [[irrigation]] in order to sustain agricultural output and take advantage of the complete growing season.

Villagers in the northwestern part of the Himalayan arc, the Karakoram and the Hindu Kush, have developed sophisticated irrigation techniques and infrastructure to cope with recurrent water scarcity [[@ashrafInfluentialAspectsGlacial2018]]. One such adaptation technology is called artificial ice reservoirs (AIR)
