# [[Ice Stupa Competition]]

In just the last 3 winters, more than 500 farmers built around 50 icestupas storing more than 120 million litres in 26 villages of this region. And whatâ€™s more, they did not receive any training, money or materials to do this. This shows how cheap and easy Icestupas are to build.
