# [[Construction process]]

A typical Icestupa just requires a fountain nozzle mounted on a supply pipeline. The water source is usually a high altitude lake or glacial stream. Due to the altitude difference between the pipeline input and fountain output, water ejects from the fountain nozzle as droplets that eventually lose their energy and accumulate as ice. Â The fountain is manually activated during the winter nights and is raised, through addition of metal pipes, when significant ice accumulates below.
