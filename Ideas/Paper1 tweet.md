New paper out today in @FrontierEarthSci by myself and amazing collaborators, incl. Hoelzle, Lehning, @Wangchuk66, @jordi_bolibar, Oerlemans and Keller, on how weather conditions in the Indian Himalayas (#Ladakh) and the Swiss Alps (#Guttannen) produce a dramatic difference in ice volume evolution of #Icestupas

We estimate that the freezing rates in Indian site was a order of magnitude higher than that of the Swiss site due to colder, drier and lesss cloudy weather conditions. Sublimation was responsible for this difference in freezing rates. The conical shape of the #Icestupas reduced direct shortwave radiation impact for both #Icestupas.

Water losses were very high due to excess fountain discharge. Vapour losses were insignificant in comparison. However, #sublimation caused 2x more vapour losses in the Indian site. But the energy balance tells a completely different story. Sublimating 1 kg of ice is equivalent in energy to freezing 9 kg of water! So the Indian AIR gained more volume DUE to higher vapour losses and NOT inspite of it.

One can estimate the water storage potential of any new site through the model. Moreover, fountain discharge can be optimised to achieve a significant water loss reduction. The model and timelapses of some AIRs can be found here: https://github.com/gayashiva/air_model

The AIR technology is ideally suited to serve as a water management strategy particularly in Central Asia or the Andes impacted by climate change induced water stress. Further details of all our findings are now freely available in this  publication:

This paper came from a big collaboration that brought together lots of expertise and institutions.
