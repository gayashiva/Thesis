In our new study, we compare the #icestupa volume evolution in Indian Himalayas (#Ladakh) and Swiss Alps (#Guttannen) to identify the surface processes that make artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs) in arid high-altitude regions grow larger and survive longer.

Using drone surveys, we calibrate and validate an #opensource AIR model that uses weather and fountain data as input to estimate the daily icestupa volumes. The model assumes the shape of the AIR to be a cone and its surface interactions to be similar to that of a glacier's.

The model was successful in reproducing the observed ice volume evolution. Field teams in India and Swiss conducted 6 and 8 drone surveys respectively. The maximum volume of Indian AIR was 4x higher than the Swiss.

Water losses were very high due to excess fountain discharge. The max freezing rate of the Indian AIR was lower than half the fountain's discharge rate. Vapour losses were insignificant in comparison. However, #sublimation caused 2x more vapour losses in the Indian site.

But the energy balance tells a completely different story. Sublimating 1 kg of ice is equivalent in energy to freezing 9 kg of water! So the Indian AIR gained more volume DUE to higher vapour losses and NOT inspite of it.

One can estimate the water storage potential of any new site through the model. Moreover, fountain discharge can be optimised to achieve a significant water loss reduction. The model and timelapses of some AIRs can be found here: https://github.com/gayashiva/air_model

The AIR technology is ideally suited to serve as a water management strategy particularly in Central Asia or the Andes impacted by climate change induced water stress. Further details of all our findings are now freely available in this  publication:
