# [[Fountain height event]]
Whenever the fountain height ($H_f$) is increased by a meter, there is a decrease in the discharge rate ($Q_f$). This can be represented through the Bernoulli equation as:

$$\rho*g*H_f + 1/2*\rho*v_1^2 = \rho*g*(H_f+1) + 1/2*\rho*v_2^2$$
$$v=Q_f/A$$
$$A=/pi*dia^2$$

where $v$ is the velocity and the pipeline diameter is $dia = 0.01875 m$. From the above equations, we get the critical discharge $Q_{crit}$ beyond which height cannot be increased to be: 

$$Q_{crit} = \sqrt{2*g} * A = 18 l/min$$
