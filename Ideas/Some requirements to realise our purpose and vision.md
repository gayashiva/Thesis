# [[Some requirements fmission]]

This is a document detailing the common purpose and mission of all our projects (GlaciersAlive, Ice Stupa/HIAL and Batken project/UNIFR). I have purposefully left out the implementation strategies used by each project and rather focus on the common requirements that each of these projects share. The intention for doing so is to critically analyse the future path of each of the projects. Personally, this represents my attempt to seek common ground between all these projects and find new ways for my future involvement which ensure realisation of our shared goals.

## Purpose
1. Support sustainable mountain development
2. Instigate/Encourage climate action

## Mission
1. Producing artificial snow for slowing down glacial retreat
2. Refreezing glacial lakes to prevent GLOFs
3. Building ice reservoirs to sustain cryosphere-fed irrigation networks

We all believe that our projects have the potential to realize their respective purposes. But certain common requirements need to be satisfied to attain these decade long goals. These are :

## Requirements
1. **Technology development** : The technology required to achieve our project goals do not exist. The development process requires decade long effort of skilled people with community engagement to customize our offerings in a cost-sensitive and reliable manner. Across our projects, we already have considerable skills and community engagement to do this. Moreover, all of our projects have similar technological requirements. *How can we discover and up-skill people long term?*
2. **Worldwide perspective** : All our goals are worldwide problems. Therefore, our implementation/communication strategies needs to enable climate action irrespective of the location. This requires exchange of people, ideas and resources across countries. *How can we ensure sufficient collaboration between the projects?*
3. **Financial Sustainability** :  All our projects run on grant money. But, as we have realized by now, grants do not provide decade long runway and therefore disincentivize longterm goals. Moreover, grants direct each of our projects towards what the funders want rather than what the communities require. This makes each of our projects heavily reliant on the current motivation of funding agencies and the capacity of the team to find/renew grant applications. *How can we fund our projects towards community-driven solutions?*

Overall, I feel all our projects suffer because of inadequate strategies addressing the above three questions.  Therefore, I have not been forthcoming to involve in any of these projects until now. However, I am still invested in the purpose and mission each of our projects share. In my view, the non-profit organizational structure of each of our projects is currently incompatible to address these problems.

I propose that we form a for-profit company with certain guiding principles that aligns with our purpose, fosters collaboration with each of our non-profit projects, showcases the ongoing technological development and acquires the necessary funding to retain a strong team that develops products sensitive to the respective location's requirements. I am willing to assume responsibility for the formation of such a company and up-skill myself accordingly. There are many business skills I lack, but this company will not just be me.

Each of your involvement is an important requirement for the foundation of such a company. You would form the board of advisors directing the recruitment, product development and your respective organization would lead the distribution and engagement with the respective community. This is why I would appreciate if you could detail your views on this proposal. Please provide both points for and against this proposal and conclude with the conditions that need to be satisfied to ensure both your wholehearted participation and the participation of the organisation you lead...

If you strongly believe that such a company cannot provide the necessary platform to further the project's mission, please state your disapproval of this whole movement so that I can reorient my career direction accordingly...
