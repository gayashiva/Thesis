# [[Some requirements to realise our purpose and mission]]
This is a document detailing the common purpose and vision of all our projects (GlaciersAlive, Ice Stupa/HIAL, Nilus and Batken project/UNIFR). I have purposefully left out the implementation strategies used by each project and rather focus on the common requirements that each of these projects share. The intention for doing so is to critically analyse the future path of each of the projects. Personally, this represents my attempt to seek common ground between all these projects and find new ways for my future involvement which ensure realisation of our shared goals.

## Purpose
1. Support sustainable mountain development
2. Encourage climate action

## Mission
1. Slowing down glacial retreat
2. Preventing glacial lake outburst floods 
3. Sustaining cryosphere-fed irrigation networks

We all believe that our projects have the potential to realize their respective purposes. But certain common requirements need to be satisfied to attain these decade long goals. These are :

## Requirements
1. Technology development :
2. Worldwide perspective : All our goals are worldwide problems. Therefore, our implementation strategies needs to be applicable 
3. Financial and Environmental Sustainability :
4. 

we also know the executing especially goals 1 and 2 could easily take upto a decade. Moreover, our project goals requires worldwide participation but all of our projects are regional and as of now have rudimentary/weak channels of collaboration.

But, according to me, certain requirements need to be satisfied to sustain such longterm projects . I base this judgement primarily on some requirements that I believe none of our projects satisfy
