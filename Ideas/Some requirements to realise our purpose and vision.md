# [[Some requirements to realise our purpose and vision]]
This is a document detailing the common purpose and vision of all our projects (GlaciersAlive, Ice Stupa, Nilus and UNDP). I have purposefully left out the implementation strategies used by each project and rather focus on the common requirements that each of these projects share. The intention for doing so is to critically analyse the future path of each of the projects. Personally, this represents my attempt to seek common ground between all these projects and find new ways for my future involvement which ensure realisation of our shared goals.

## Purpose
1. Slowing down glacial retreat
2. Preventing glacial lake outburst floods
3.
