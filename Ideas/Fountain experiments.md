# [[Fountain experiments]]

So the next crucial step in Icestupa reasearch is to understand the fountain characteristics better. I believe the fountain influence can be quantified using its height, aperture diameter and angle of spray. From our energy balance calculations, we can already say what maximum ice radius will be given the weather conditions of the location. The spray radius of the fountain used should be higher than this ice radius to obtain maximum ice volume. However, it is still not clear how the spray radius can be determined using the fountain characteristics. Here are the key questions we need your help in understanding:

1. What is the relationship between droplet diameter and fountain aperture diameter?
2.  How to model the projectile motion of these water droplets better?
3. What is the distribution of the water droplets inside the spray radius?
4. What is the water pressure loss due to the fountains?
