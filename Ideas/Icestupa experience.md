# [[Icestupa experience]]

Together with HIAL, I have been helping these farmers construct Icestupas for the last 6 years. But, still, any time we build an Icestupa at a new location, we never know what to expect. Will this Icestupa grow big enough to break our old records or will it not even last the heat of the next day?

I often questioned myself whether Icestupas are a good way to achieve winter water storage. Watching the icestupa freezing in the winter, I wondered whether all the water we sprayed was freezing or just ending up in a puddle somewhere. Watching the icestupa melting under the summer sun, I wondered how much of the water we stored was just evaporating back into the atmosphere. These were the questions I brought with me later when I started my PhD.

At UniFR, we designed an Icestupa measurement campaign using flowmeters, weather stations and drones. Just last winter, we built and measured Icestupas simultaneously in Ladakh and Switzerland.
