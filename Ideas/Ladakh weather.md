# [[Ladakh weather]]

Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region in northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the Himalayas and receives on average fewer than ten centimeters of rain/snow per year. As local glaciers shrink because of climate change, regional water scarcity is increasing. _And so, local farmers have started growing their own ice reservoirs as insurance against this uncertainty.
