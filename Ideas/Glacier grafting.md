# [[Glacier grafting]]

For centuries, in the Himalayan mountain ranges, local cultures have believed that glaciers are alive. And what’s more, that certain glaciers can have different genders including male and female. These people ‘breed’ new glaciers by grafting together—or marrying—fragments of ice from male and female glaciers, then covering them with charcoal, wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce in privacy. These glacierets transform into fully active glaciers that grow each year with additional snowfall. Those then serve as lasting reserves of water that farmers can use to irrigate their crops. Over the years, these practices have inspired other cultures, where people are creating their own artificial ice reservoirs(AIRs) and applying them to solve serious modern challenges around water supplies.
