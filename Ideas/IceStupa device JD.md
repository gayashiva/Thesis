# [[Job Description: IceStupa device ]]

In short, this device attempts to make the construction of artificial ice reservoirs maintenance-free and efficient. The automation hardware consists of an automatic weather station (AWS), solenoid valve, drain valves, air valves, fountain, pipeline and a raspberry pi. The raspberry pi feeds the AWS data to the automation software. This software sends an open/close signal to the solenoid valve to switch the fountain on/off.  A flowmeter and a pressure valve are also integrated with the pipeline to record the discharge characteristics. 

There are several challenges related to the production of this device for our use cases in Ladakh. For example, how to make all the components resilient against subzero conditions? How to design these weather-sensitive solenoid valves in a cost-effective manner?  Therefore, it would take considerable prototyping and research to arrive at practical solutions. 

I have already designed the AWS and raspberry pi system and tested it in Ladakh or weather data collection. I have also created the automation system and tested it in Switzerland. A timelapse of the automated Swiss icestupa can be found here. However, the Swiss automation system is far too expensive and impractical for use at scale in Ladakh. So I wish to replicate the system through your help and also achieve some cost reduction in the process. These activities were carried out as part of my PhD and have resulted in publications. One of it is online here and the other is under review but can be shared once future involvement is confirmed.

This work package has both remote work (part-time) and field work(fulltime) components. During remote work, you will be primarily responsible for establishing the hardware interface between the raspberry pi and the solenoid. Secondary objectives will be to integrate the flowmeter and pressure valve into the pipeline. 

During fieldwork, we will be based in Ladakh ideally from October where we will test this automated system for weather resilience and develop the components further accordingly. 50 mm high density polyethylene pipelines would be used for the field tests. 

I am willing to pay 20,000 per month during fulltime employment. Accomodation, travel and flights in Ladakh will also be covered. The prototype development can be performed remotely. It is hard to both time and price this part of the work but maybe we can arrive at a per hour rate for this part of the job.
