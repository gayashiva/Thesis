# [[Startup Proposal]]
The last 4 years of research have answered several nagging questions I had about icestupas. For example, where can such ice reservoirs be a viable strategy for seasonal water storage? How can they be scaled efficiently to serve irrigation needs of villages instead of just one plantation? How can the construction process be optimised to build large ice reservoirs with no manual interventions?

Learnings and prototypes that answer all the above questions have been documented in the course of the PhD.   But none of these learnings will be used without further iterations and improvements of the materials used. The science backing the technology has been scrutinised and exposed sufficiently to prove the potential of its application. It is now time to improve the technology based on the scientific facts discovered. 

The engineering design of the current water storage technology has several drawbacks. Firstly, it requires significant maintenance. Secondly, the fountain systems used are very inefficient. Through our research, we have successfully showcased prototypes that produce efficient and maintenance-free AIRs.

The next big challenge is to (a) scale the technology in size and (b) distribute it to other suitable locations. Over the past decade, we have seen how different village teams adapted the technology to suit their location's water supply and tog 

Executing these steps requires engineering better fountain spray systems. There are many different construction methodologies
