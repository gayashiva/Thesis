# [[Startup Proposal]]
The last 4 years of research have answered several nagging questions I had about [icestupas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdVijr10DZ0). For example, where can such ice reservoirs be a viable strategy for water storage? How can they be scaled efficiently to serve irrigation needs of villages instead of just one plantation? How can the construction process be optimised to build larger ice reservoirs with no manual interventions?

In the course of my PhD, we showed that the construction location and fountain chosen in the current construction strategy can be optimised through two publications. The [first publication](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2021.771342/full) showed that the current construction strategy requires significant maintenance and their fountain systems used are very inefficient. In our [second publication](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jb6bV6Frz0ZGSfcSRZ-7sWS2E9z1t2ym/view?usp=sharing), we successfully showcase prototypes that produce efficient and maintenance-free AIRs. However, the improved construction strategy proposed needs to be customised for mountain farmers to reduce its cost and increase its reliability.

The next challenge, therefore, is to (a) scale the technology in size and (b) distribute it to other suitable locations. Over the past decade, we have seen how more than 30 different teams in Chile, Kyrgyztan, Switzerland and India adapted the technology to suit their location's water supply and topographical conditions. Some suspended the fountains over ropes and others let water run directly over a cliff without fountains. There are also villages that still rely on ice terraces for their water supply. [Other publications](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10113-018-1372-0/tables/1) estimate that these alternative construction strategies can store **30 times** more water than ice stupas. However, none of these alternative construction strategies have been explored to date. Moreover, these alternative strategies remain unoptimised further limiting their true potential. Therefore, to achieve both (a) and (b), one has to compare all these alternative construction strategies both quantitatively and qualitatively while implementing similar ways to make these construction strategies more efficient and maintenance-free.  

However, executing these steps requires significant engineering expertise to carry out several iterations of technology development. Therefore, I propose that we build a startup to employ the necessary talent, fund the experiments and distribute the customised products based on the user location's topographical conditions and water demands. This startup will integrate with all the non-profit organizations currently engaged with this technology and its users. In this way, the startup will also be sensitive to the needs and demands of the customers and make its products cost-effective for the user base. The focus market that this startup serves its products are described briefly below:
