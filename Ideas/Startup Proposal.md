# [[Startup Proposal]]
The last 4 years of research have answered several nagging questions I had about icestupas. For example, where can such ice reservoirs be a viable strategy for seasonal water storage? How can they be scaled efficiently to serve irrigation needs of villages instead of just one plantation? How can the construction process be optimised to build large ice reservoirs with no manual interventions?

Learning and prototypes that answer all the above questions have been documented in the course of the PhD.   But none of these learning will be used without further iterations and improvements of the materials used. The science backing the technology has been scrutinized and exposed sufficiently to prove the potential of its application. It is now time to improve the technology based on the scientific facts discovered. 

The engineering design of the current water storage technology has several drawbacks. Firstly, it requires significant maintenance. Secondly, the fountain systems used are very inefficient. Through our research, we have successfully showcased prototypes that produce efficient and maintenance-free AIRs.

The next big challenge is to (a) scale the technology in size and (b) distribute it to other suitable locations. Over the past decade, we have seen how more than 30 different village teams in Chile, Kyrgyztan and India adapted the technology to suit their location's water supply and topographical conditions. Some suspended the fountains over ropes and others let water run directly over a cliff without fountains. There are also villages that still rely on horizontal ice reservoirs for their water supply. Literature estimates that horizontal ice reservoirs store 30 times more than vertical ones. However, none of these alternative construction strategies have been explored to date. Therefore, to achieve both (a) and (b), one has to compare all these alternative construction strategies both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, similar ways can be applied to make these construction strategy more efficient and maintenance-free.  

However, executing these steps requires significant engineering expertise together with several iterations. Thankfully, most of the improvements can be performed in the comfort of a laboratory since the influence of meteorological conditions is now well defined. Therefore, I propose that we build a startup to specifically perform these iterations of the construction system and design customised products based on the user location's topographical conditions and water demands. This startup could provide the ideal platform to nurture the engineering team and to communicate with potential customers. This startup will integrate with all the non-profit organizations currently engaged with the farmers using this technology. In this way, the startup will also be sensitive to the needs and demands of the customers and make its products cost-effective fo the user base. The focus market that this startup serves its products are described briefly below:
