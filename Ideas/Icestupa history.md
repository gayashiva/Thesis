1. The fascinating history of artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs). A thread
2. In the Himalayan ranges, local cultures have believed that glaciers are alive. These people ‘breed’ new glaciers by grafting together or marrying fragments of ice from male and female glaciers, then covering them up so that they can reproduce *in privacy*. Even though this practice is rooted in folklore with little results to show, mountain communities build these kind of AIRs even now:   
3. In 1987, Chewang Norphel, a local engineer in Ladakh, was intrigued by this belief and began to sketch some designs. Streams would be gently slowed by a series of walls until the water froze, little by little, as an AIR.  Over the next 20 years, Chewang built several AIRs in Ladakh. 
4. However, after he retired, not many villagers were able to continue his efforts. Building these AIRs required construction of stone walls in shadowed valleys at altitudes higher than 4000 m. This was such a gargantuan effort that whole villages had to pool their time and money to construct the necessary infrastructure.
5. Meanwhile, another local engineer, Sonam Wangchuk, discovered a solitary piece of ice lying happily under a bridge in the middle of May. Many would have dismissed this discovery as commonplace but not Sonam. He hypothesized that the ice lasted so long not just due to the shade but also due to its conical shape.
6. To prove his hypothesis, Sonam designed fountain systems to make conical AIRs and deployed them in the worst possible location: near the shores of the river Indus. When this AIR survived longer than any other, the whole world voted with their wallets to kick start the era of AIRs:
7. The first working prototype complete with a farm below the AIR was built in partnership with the local buddhist monastery. The villagers were moved by the size and shape of the AIR. A prayer and plantation ceremony was conducted to transform AIRs into #Icestupas:
8. #Icestupas infused new hope in Ladakh. Flo
