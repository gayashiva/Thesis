# [[Icestupa history]]
1. The fascinating history of artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs). A thread
2. In the Himalayan ranges, local cultures have believed that glaciers are alive. These people ‘breed’ new glaciers by grafting together or marrying fragments of ice from male and female glaciers, then covering them up so that they can reproduce *in privacy*. The practice maybe rooted in folklore but the efforts of these mountain communities astounded many:   
3. One such person was Chewang Norphel, a local engineer from Ladakh. Once, he saw water dripping from a tap gradually froze into the shape of an ice sheet as it came in touch with the ground and made a pool. He realised that if streams could be gently slowed by a series of walls until the water froze to construct AIRs.  Over the next 20 years, Chewang built several AIRs in Ladakh. 
4. However, after he retired, not many villagers were able to continue his efforts. Building these AIRs required construction of stone walls in shadowed valleys at altitudes higher than 4000 m. This was such a gargantuan effort that whole villages had to pool their time and money to construct the necessary infrastructure.
5. Meanwhile, another local engineer, Sonam Wangchuk, discovered a solitary piece of ice lying happily under a bridge in the middle of May. Many would have dismissed this discovery as commonplace but not Sonam. He hypothesized that this ice lasted longer not just due to the shade but also due to its conical shape.
6. To prove his hypothesis, Sonam designed fountain systems to make conical AIRs and deployed them in the worst possible location: near the shores of the river Indus. When this AIR survived longer than any other, the whole world voted with their wallets to kick start the era of AIRs:
7. The first working prototype of Sonam's AIR was managed in a unique way. The funds from the crowdfunding campaign were distributed by the Phyang monastery to fund the living expenses of villagers and volunteers constructing the AIR. I was one such volunteer working with engineers, monks, farmers and students watching in awe how our small actions transformed these ice structures. 
8.  Icestupa creation is an intricate process. It requires millions of droplets to find a cold and gentle parcel of air to guide it on the surface of the #icestupa. But the process itself, as laborious, as precise, as artistic, is not really the message. When the icestupa has finished forming, we pray over it and then let it destroy itself for the plants below. The saplings mop it up, every last drop of water leaving only their new  as a final memory of this sublime possibility.
9.  In 2015, to commemorate the success of the first prototype, 1000 villagers planted 5 saplings each. A buddhist prayer ceremony accompanied the plantation ceremony to transform AIRs into #Icestupas.
10. Watching them slowly form drop by drop every hour of every day and then disappear into the plants  in the winter and transforming into trees in the summer. 
11. Once, to gauge the excitement, I personally sat near our #Icestupa entrance and lost count watching more than 100 villagers entering our experiment site in an hour! The #Icestupa had become a pilgrimage site:
12. Winning the Rolex awards for enterprise was the next milestone for the project. The award money helped us build the HIAL university to foster more solutions for mountain communities. The attention that it garnered helped us discover our Swiss partners @GlaciersAlive. Rolex movie:
13. A vibrant exchange programme began between GlaciersAlive and HIAL. More than a dozen students from India and Switzerland have interned in GlaciersAlive and HIAL since 2017. Swiss students learn about Ladakh's frugal and sustainable lifestyle and Indian students learn about Switzerland's winter tourism industry. Hial link:
14. I was one such exchange student to undergo this internship. It was a crucial stepping stone that paved the way for developing the AIR technology further via a PhD. Abstract:
