# [[AIR grid cell identification]]
- Ideal [[AIR]] cells satisfy the following:
1. A 5 m high [[AIR]] (min_AIR_height = 5) can only be built if there is sufficient water head. If half the head is lost (pressure_loss_factor = 2). Then the  difference between the altitude of the glacier terminus (terminus_alt) and above the altitude where atleast one month has longterm subzero temperatures (subzero_alt) has to be atleast 10 m. Therefore :

				terminus_alt - subzero_alt > pressure_loss_factor * min_AIR_height
2. The AIR pipeline length (pipe_length) has to be less than 10 km for the AIR construction to be economically feasible. Since we know the average slope of the terrain, this means:

				(terminus_alt - subzero_alt)/avg_slope < 10
				
2. Irrigation altitude (irig_alt) has to be above the subzero_alt so that AIRs can be built close to the plantations. 

				irig_alt - subzero_alt > 0
