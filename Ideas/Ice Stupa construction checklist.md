# [[Ice stupa construction checklist ]]

![[Pasted image 20220607102932.png]]
*Icestupa at Shara, Ladakh, built by local farmers, stored more than 10 million litres and survived for around a year.*

## Regional checklist
  1. Water source within 10 km of the site.
  2. Mean temperature of construction period less than - 2 C.
  3. Number of subzero nights during construction period is greater than 30.
  4. Terrain slope between water source and site greater than 10 m every km. 

## Terrain checklist
  1. Temperature is lower.
  2. Water source: spring water better than glacial water.
  3. Cloudy days are lower.
  4. Humidity is lower.
  5. Daylight hours is lower.
  6. Terrain slope is higher.


## Material checklist:
1. Pipeline : High density polyethylene pipes are more resistant to freezing in our experience. 
2. Fountain nozzles can be either shared via the icestupa project or sourced locally.

Such a village can create ice stupa which can grow to millions of litres and supply around 10,000 litres of meltwater for 2 months (April and May).
