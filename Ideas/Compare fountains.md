Values based on Guttannen at water pressure 6 bar?

To understand how we made these decisions, I want to walk you through the charecteristics of each of the fountain and discuss their implications. The 3 fountains are named as Ray, Disc and Mist fountain respectively. The name signifies the way in which water spreads from the fountain nozzle which is quite unique. Below, is a table summarising the fountain charecteristics:

Our objective this winter is to 
1. prevent pipeline freezing
2. reduce water loss 
3. increase freezing rate

The pipeline freezing risk directly can be judged by the fountain droplet size because the smaller the droplets the higher the chance of them freezing on the fountain itself and blocking the fountain aperture. Also, smaller droplets are produced by fountains that already have a smaller aperture, so such fountains also have a higher drainage time. So, the ray fountain is the winner here because it does not freeze itself and also allows fast pipeline drainage.

To optimise for objectives 2 and 3, we can use activation temperature as a measure. Activation temperature corresponds to the temperature when the minimum discharge is achieved. The lower the activation temperature the lower the fountain runtime. So mist fountain is the winner here. But the mist fountain only supports a maximum discharge of just half of the other fountains due to its low aperture area. So yes, we are compromising on freezing rate here to reduce water loss.

We can now eliminate Disc fountain from our choices. Between the rest of the fountains, mist fountain is better since its fountain runtime is much higher. Also the freezing rate of the mist fountain is underestimated by our equation since it is calibrated for the ray fountain with much larger droplets.
