# [[Sublimation effect]]

Sublimation and evaporation losses were negligible but the corresponding energy losses were quite significant. It was because of freezing energy generated by sublimation, the Indian Icestupa was able to grow much bigger and last longer compared to the Swiss Icestupa. But both Icestupas suffered high water losses, around 80 percent of their fountain water input mainly due to excess fountain spray.
