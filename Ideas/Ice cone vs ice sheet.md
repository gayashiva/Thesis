# [[Ice cone vs ice sheet]]

Constructing ice reservoirs is not new, in the past these were built as ice sheets much higher up the mountains, making them difficult to manage. Now, as ice cones, they are built next to where the water is needed most, right on the outskirts of villages, near their fields. So the shape was the key innovation that made them particularly inexpensive and easy to maintain.

A popular hypothesis was that as ice cones are better because they had lesser surface area per unit volume. But surface area favours both freezing as well as melting. So it is not clear why minimizing surface area should be an objective.
