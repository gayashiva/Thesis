# [[Requirements for Ice stupa construction]]

*Icestupa at Shara, Ladakh, built by local farmers, stored more than 10 million litres and survived for around a year.*

## A sketch of an ideal village:
1. **Weather suitability**: Easiest way to determine this is to count the number of subzero nights during winter/construction period. Around 1000 hours of subzero temperature is required to build ice stupas. The mean temperature of the location should atleast be -2 C.
2. **Water supply and pipeline**: Minimum water supply required to run the fountain is around 2 l/min. Maximum observed ice stupa freezing rate is 14 l/min. Ideal water source type is spring. However, glacial streams can also be used but the pipelines then need heavy insulation. Pipeline head determines the height and volume of the ice stupa. Ideally this should atleast be 15 m. Also the pipeline length should not be too long. Typical ice stupa pipelines are as long as 3 km with a 60 m head.
3. **Topography**: Shadowed valleys are preferred to make the ice stupa provide meltwater for longer durations.
4. **Altitude zone**: Since temperature decreases with altitude, a higher altitude is preferred. But lower altitudes in shaded valleys perform better since they dont receive much solar radiation 
5. **Fountain and pipeline material**: High density polyethylene pipes are more resistant to freezing in our experience. Fountain design and nozzles we have developed can be shared via the icestupa project. All these products can be sourced locally.

Such a village can create ice stupa which can grow to millions of litres and supply around 10,000 litres of meltwater for 2 months (April and May). Please contact me if further details are required.
